things to do

1) add a button to bring a simple options page.
2) add an advanced button to bring up more pages.
3) call the config maker? port the config maker?
4) have the option to save the current setup as a config, or batch/sh
5) have bzfs and bzflag write out the exe locations each time they run, so we know what the last run set of apps are.
   then if the lancher has no custom paths in it's prefs try to use the last run paths. If only the client has been
   run, infer the server location from the client and see if it exists.
   
6) have the option to specify a config.
7) add the option for a server password
