README for Win32 platforms
--------------------------


Command line development tools on Win32 are in the stone age.
NMAKE is bad but COMMAND.COM is infinitely worse.  So, for
now, bzflag uses Microsoft Visual C++ project files.
Unfortunately, as you might expect, a visual development
environment doesn't integrate well with the command line
and doesn't give you much in the way of custom build rules
(it gives you NMAKE, and if NMAKE was good enough i wouldn't
use VC++ projects).

So, to build bzflag on Win32, get Visual C++ or something
that can read Visual C++ projects and workspaces.  Then:

  * open win32\bzflag.dsw
  * select `bzflag Release' as the active configuration
  * build
  * select `bzfs Release' as the active configuration
  * build
  * select `bzfls Release' as the active configuration
  * build

To build the installer:

  * open package\win32\install.dsw
  * select bzfinst Release as the active configuration
  * Rebuild all

--- or ------------------------------------------------------------
  * open package\win32\install.dsw
  * select `bzfuinst Release' as the active configuration
  * build
  * select `makedb Release' as the active configuration
  * build
  * in a command shell:
    * cd package\win32
    * mkdir lib
    * bin\makedb.exe -i bzflag.spc -o lib\database.obj -b 1048576

    makedb compresses the files and doesn't do it very
    efficiently, so expect it to take a while.  larger block
    sizes take longer but compress better.

  * in VC++, select `bzfinst Release' as the active configuration
  * build

The installer is dist/bzfinst.exe.
