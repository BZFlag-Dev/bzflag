to do list for bzflag
---------------------

* encapsulate stuff requiring platform #ifdef's:
   networking API into libNet.a.
   fork/exec (used in menus.cxx) into libPlatform.a
   file system stuff (dir delimiter, etc.)
   user name stuff

* write bzfbiff
   watch server for players;  run program when somebody joins

* windows makefiles
   currently have microsoft visual c++ projects only

* auto-generated dependency support in makefiles
   manual dependencies cause too much trouble

* smarter robots

* add type of shot (normal, gm, sw, etc) to killed message

* support resolutions besides 640x480 on passthrough 3Dfx cards
