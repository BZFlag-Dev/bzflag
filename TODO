to do list for bzflag
---------------------

* encapsulate stuff requiring platform #ifdef's:
   networking API into libNet.a.
   file system stuff (dir delimiter, etc.)

* windows makefiles
   currently have microsoft visual c++ projects only

* auto-generated dependency support in makefiles
   manual dependencies cause too much trouble

* move robots to separate binaries and allow either the
   client or server to exec them. Have a server option
   to keep n players in the game which auto spawns/kills
   enough bots to do it. Get rid of bot player type
   completely. bots should get all message types.

* smarter robots

* add type of shot (normal, gm, sw, etc) to killed message

* more flag types

* mines:
   not necessarily a good idea.  if mines are visible
   then they're fairly useless.  if invisible then they're
   not fun because you're destroyed without warning and
   no amount of skill will help you.  someone suggested
   making them visible within a certain range.  another
   possibility is damage before destruction.

* radio chat:
   allow players to communicate via low-quality audio.
   already some support built into the server for this.

* pre-game waiting room:
   provide a means for players to gather before and after
   a game.  basic text chat facilities.  allows players
   to wait for enough players for a game and to discuss
   strategy, etc.  could build this into bzfs easily.

* spectator mode. Possibly only through a relay server
  so as to not load down the normal server.

* one tcp port. Tim Riker is working on this code. 1.7e4
  should include playerid mangling support to get ready
  for this patch.
