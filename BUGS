------------

- Server handles MsgKilled correctly, but client displays it as 'killed by                       
  unknown>'; killer id is -1=InvalidPlayer, why not ServerPlayer?  

- Spawn code sometimes spawns you mid-air

- Robots don't do z collision checks other than to see if z < 0.
  So if a base.z > 0 hilarity ensues. 
  A quick fix would make bots always spawn at 0

  start as bzfs -world c:\robobase.bzw -fb -j -c


- doc/guide/NetworkProtocol.xml is not up to date

- list server includes counts for players running on non-public/mis-configured
  servers on the same machine on different ports.  if server runs on port 5156
  with publicaddr set to machine:5156 and then also runs another on 59999 with
  publicaddr set to machine:5156 (by accident or otherwise), then player joins
  to the 59999 server mask the 5156 server.  it'd be easy to blow this off as
  expected behavior, but I expect one can also trojan any server's counts 
  using this same technique..

- bunny hunt issues.  observed the player selection consistently toggle
  between the best player (score-wise) and one of the worst players non-stop
  for several (10+) minutes without choosing many intermediate players that
  not only had better scores and were not dead and were not previously bunny
  and had a much better value for killCount * (killCount - deathCount)
  mac suspects valid players are getting skipped altogether for some reason..
  (player state is not alive ?, etc) need to test that theory. 
  Perhaps a client hack is foobar'ing it as well. This seems to happen only occasionally.
  Often rabbit selection works just fine, but when its broken, it stays broken.

- Shift+Tab seems to be bound to jump without being bound to jump
  It doesn't happen on Linux. Shift+Tab action is untranslated by XLookupString
  (xfree86 4.3), so need custom code to go into bzflag. 

- menu does not display modified values after quitting and returning, although
  the bindings appear to remain in effect.

- Flaghelp falls into the radar area when radar is 'bigger'

- Address Exception reported when unpacking a FlagType in MsgFlagUpdate on
  client in Rabbit game. The reported message buffer address was bad (ie
  0xbfffd7ed) Could we be running off the end of the packet (ie count is
  fubar'ed?) Perhaps add sanity check for not overruning end of buffer.

- On a FFA game, where no purple was allowed a Team size of 65535 was displayed
  for Purple.

- bzadmin seems to be less responsive over the network than bzflag - a
  bzadmin client can get kicked from a very active game by the server
  for causing it to queue too many packages (there's a limit at 20kB, when I
  removed it the queue went up to at least 64kB)

- Killed tanks continue drifting and leave tank bits floating around on the
  modified gravity ducati.  players seem to continue forwarding after landing
  until X time as if gravity was unchanged.

- os x client audio is very choppy when the user has a sound card installed

- bzfs should re-resolve the list server IP if it can't reach it for an update

- make maintainer-clean does not enter DIST_SUBDIRS
  so all Makefile.in and Makefile files are not removed correctly
  (this is probably a bug in automake 1.4, not in our files)

---------------------

see the bug tracker on SourceForge for more
http://SourceForge.net/tracker/?group_id=3248&atid=103248

* exploding tank parts sometimes move along the ground instead of
   flying up into the air.

* not dropping a flag grabbed just before being destroyed

* same stipple on teleporters and phantom zone, making phatom
   tank behind teleporter virtually invisible when blending is off.

* not drawing back to front when depth buffer is on:
   flag edges can't be antialiased right
   teleporter blended on top of shots in front of them

* line stipple doesn't (can't) match polygon stipple
   messes up shadow of flag stem

* can sometimes appear in front of bad guys

* some linux systems get XIO error on startup
   no idea why but it's consistent on those systems
   (probably XIJoystick code?)

* not blanking screen during win32 startup
   should black out screen before changing resolutions
   should raise on top of task bar
   also black out screen when quitting until resolution restored

* error dialogs on win32 may appear off screen
   only when display resolution was changed
