recent bugs
------------

- When a rabbit pauses and no other players are in the game, the server will
  choose the pauser as the rabbit again. Then the player will again request
  that the server choose a different player, thus leading to a happy
  ping-pong of messages until player unpauses or another player joins.

- src/bzflag/ShotStrategy.cxx SegmentedShotStrategy::makeSegments will not
  handle shots that bounce 'down', it presenly ends them. it should make
  them bounce when they hit the gound.

- a number of places that used to be notified on menu changes (such as BigFont)
  no longer do, due to the move to BZDB. We need to add callbacks for these
  in BZDB

- make maintainer-clean does not enter DIST_SUBDIRS
  so all Makefile.in and Makefile files are not removed correctly

* exploding tank parts sometimes move along the ground instead of
   flying up into the air.

* not dropping a flag grabbed just before being destroyed

* same stipple on teleporters and phantom zone, making phatom
   tank behind teleporter virtually invisible when blending is off.

* hit detection on pyramids computed at altitude of ray origin

* not drawing back to front when depth buffer is on:
   flag edges can't be antialiased right
   teleporter blended on top of shots in front of them

* line stipple doesn't (can't) match polygon stipple
   messes up shadow of flag stem

* can sometimes appear in front of bad guys

* some linux systems get XIO error on startup
   no idea why but it's consistent on those systems
   (probably XIJoystick code?)

* not blanking screen during win32 startup
   should black out screen before changing resolutions
   should raise on top of task bar
   also black out screen when quitting until resolution restored

* error dialogs on win32 may appear off screen
   only when display resolution was changed

* collision problems
   can sometimes get stuck on a pyramid or in a corner.  also
   picking up the obese flag close to a building can cause you
   to get stuck.

* robots are just too stupid

* robots can sometimes go through buildings
   the code to generate the cells of open space are susceptible
   to roundoff error, causing an open cell inside a building.
