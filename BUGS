recent bugs
------------
- bzc file writing seems to be goofy. Some options never are written into
  the file, and some (binds) get written more than once. [I have two 
  bind lines for the same key]

- PyramidBuilding::getHitNormal seems to handle flipz wrongly, specifically
  if (flip)
    oHeight = -oHeight;
  if (oHeight < 0) {
    flip    = !flip;
    oHeight = -oHeight;
  }
  Given a Pyr with positive height, and flipz, causes flipz to be off, and the 
  height to be positive. Which is incorrect.

  It would seem we should completely revert the code to back when flipped pyrs where 
  not considered. Then, if flipz, and the hit point is between the top and bottom, just 
  reflect the point across the height, calculate the normal, and then flip the z.
  (ie if pyr pos = 5 size = 10, and hit[z] = 7, then convert hit[z] = 13.
  From that get normal, then normal[z] = -normal[z].
  Does that seem right?

- Rabbit selection is borken. Two things. A player often is Rabbit two times
  in a row, which was intended to be illegal, and high scoring tanks get bypassed.
  Was playing on ducati where a player was consistantly in #1 slot, but NEVER 
  was rabbit.

- Address Exception reported when unpacking a FlagType in MsgFlagUpdate on client
  in Rabbit game. The reported message buffer address was bad (ie 0xbfffd7ed)
  Could we be running off the end of the packet (ie count is fubar'ed?)
  Perhaps add sanity check for not overruning end of buffer.

- Player kicked after getting V flag (and possibly TH) stolen by another thief.

- if you jump up and hit a flipped pyramid you will stick to it until you
  move again (see PyramidBuilding::getHitNormal above)

- bzadmin seems to be less responsive over the network than bzflag - a 
  bzadmin client can get kicked from a very active game by the server 
  for causing it to queue too many packages (there's a limit at 20kB, when I
  removed it the queue went up to at least 64kB)

- Player continues to see the locked on me message after death until 
  shooter locked onto a different target. (Nidhoggr reported this)

- Sometimes when you pick up MG, the tank automatically, and constantly
  starts firing all the shots over and over. Seen no Mac and Windows.

- Killed tanks continue drifting and leave tank bits floating around on the
  modified gravity ducati.  players seem to continue forwarding after landing
  until X time as if gravity was unchanged.

- Observer controls get confused sometimes. To see, push control and arrows
  to spin. While keys are down, push alt. Now release all. You continue spinning
  un aided. Now stop yourself. Now alt doesn't work. Bagheera reports he gets
  into situations where movement is out of control.

- new list server takes way too long (3-5 seconds) to respond.
  Taking some measurement from receiving request to sending result:
  bzfls.pl on Tim's     : 1.8 sec
  bzflsMy.php on brlcad : 0.3 sec
  bzflsLite on brlcad   : 0.3 sec

- os x client audio is very choppy when the user has a sound card installed

- trouble remapping the "Identify/Respawn" key from "right mouse or i" to
  something else.  tried remapping to "w" during gameplay and it fails for
  windows and os x.  also fails to respawn with right mouse if you try to
  change the setting during game.  the values do not appear to be persistent
  properly either (quit and return and it's displayed wrong).

- resetting key map doesn't seem to fully erase the current bindings before
  reapplying defaults (same bug as above?)

- bzfs should re-resolve the list server IP if it can't reach it for an update

- make maintainer-clean does not enter DIST_SUBDIRS
  so all Makefile.in and Makefile files are not removed correctly
  (this is probably a bug in automake 1.4, not in our files)

older bugs in BZFlag
---------------------

see the bug tracker on SourceForge for more
http://SourceForge.net/tracker/?group_id=3248&atid=103248

* exploding tank parts sometimes move along the ground instead of
   flying up into the air.

* not dropping a flag grabbed just before being destroyed

* same stipple on teleporters and phantom zone, making phatom
   tank behind teleporter virtually invisible when blending is off.

* not drawing back to front when depth buffer is on:
   flag edges can't be antialiased right
   teleporter blended on top of shots in front of them

* line stipple doesn't (can't) match polygon stipple
   messes up shadow of flag stem

* can sometimes appear in front of bad guys

* some linux systems get XIO error on startup
   no idea why but it's consistent on those systems
   (probably XIJoystick code?)

* not blanking screen during win32 startup
   should black out screen before changing resolutions
   should raise on top of task bar
   also black out screen when quitting until resolution restored

* error dialogs on win32 may appear off screen
   only when display resolution was changed
