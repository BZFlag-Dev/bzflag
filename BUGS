recent bugs
------------

- on flag capture, there is no "cheer" music played.  was observer at the
  time so it may be observer issues, maybe not.

- bunny hunt issues.  observed the player selection consistently toggle
  between the best player (score-wise) and one of the worst players non-stop
  for several (10+) minutes without choosing many intermediate players that
  not only had better scores and were not dead and were not previously bunny
  and had a much better value for 	killCount * (killCount - deathCount)
  mac suspects valid players are getting skipped altogether for some reason..
  need to test that theory.

- Shift+Tab seems to be bound to jump without being bound to jump

- menu does not display modified values after quitting and returning, although
  the bindings appear to remain in effect.  

- issuing a /set command in bzadmin with no arguments does not provide a list
  of settable variables.

- thief sound is too dang loud.  the players are all gonna go deaf if someone
  doesn't tone that puppy down a bit.

- Flaghelp falls into the radar area when radar is 'bigger'

- Address Exception reported when unpacking a FlagType in MsgFlagUpdate on
  client in Rabbit game. The reported message buffer address was bad (ie
  0xbfffd7ed) Could we be running off the end of the packet (ie count is
  fubar'ed?) Perhaps add sanity check for not overruning end of buffer.

- On a FFA game, where no purple was allowed a Team size of 65535 was displayed
  for Purple.

- Rabbit selection is borken. Two things. A player often is Rabbit two times
  in a row, which was intended to be illegal, and high scoring tanks get
  bypassed.  Was playing on ducati where a player was consistantly in #1 slot,
  but NEVER was rabbit. (The latter probaby happens when all players have a
  negative score, the formula does not work well then). Nope: Top player was
  44-31 or there abouts. HMM. I played again and the picking was fine. Could it
  be a cheat client, causing havoc?

- bzadmin seems to be less responsive over the network than bzflag - a
  bzadmin client can get kicked from a very active game by the server
  for causing it to queue too many packages (there's a limit at 20kB, when I
  removed it the queue went up to at least 64kB)

- Player continues to see the locked on me message after death until
  shooter locked onto a different target. (Nidhoggr reported this)

- Killed tanks continue drifting and leave tank bits floating around on the
  modified gravity ducati.  players seem to continue forwarding after landing
  until X time as if gravity was unchanged.

- os x client audio is very choppy when the user has a sound card installed

- bzfs should re-resolve the list server IP if it can't reach it for an update

- make maintainer-clean does not enter DIST_SUBDIRS
  so all Makefile.in and Makefile files are not removed correctly
  (this is probably a bug in automake 1.4, not in our files)

---------------------

see the bug tracker on SourceForge for more
http://SourceForge.net/tracker/?group_id=3248&atid=103248

* exploding tank parts sometimes move along the ground instead of
   flying up into the air.

* not dropping a flag grabbed just before being destroyed

* same stipple on teleporters and phantom zone, making phatom
   tank behind teleporter virtually invisible when blending is off.

* not drawing back to front when depth buffer is on:
   flag edges can't be antialiased right
   teleporter blended on top of shots in front of them

* line stipple doesn't (can't) match polygon stipple
   messes up shadow of flag stem

* can sometimes appear in front of bad guys

* some linux systems get XIO error on startup
   no idea why but it's consistent on those systems
   (probably XIJoystick code?)

* not blanking screen during win32 startup
   should black out screen before changing resolutions
   should raise on top of task bar
   also black out screen when quitting until resolution restored

* error dialogs on win32 may appear off screen
   only when display resolution was changed
