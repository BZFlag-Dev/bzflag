recent bugs
------------

-- bots--
- Segfault - bzflag -solo 2 gets rejected - too many bots from a single IP
  The message doesn't display on the client and the client crashes
  Possibly related to 
  
- client side bots make the client get disconnected (read error)
  below.
  
- client side bots don't even show as tanks.

-- crashes ---
- two clients connecting (at least from the same IP) causes the second
  to have communication failures and get disconnected.

- Segfault - two clients connecting to the server then leaving causes the 
  server to crash
  
- starting for the first time on a new install seems to geek on the config
  creation on at least 2 OSs, ( linux and OSX ).
   
- client crashes upon receipt of a corrupted MsgFlagUpdate message.
  (See http://bzflag.secretplace.us/packet.txt for an example)
  
- reached assertion on either World::getTeleportTarget() or
  World::getTeleporter() after getting killed while jumping towards a
  teleporter (and landing in front of the teleporter, albeit dead).  i
  didn't respawn, waited a couple sec (was chatting), then the assertion was
  raised.
  
- Address Exception reported when unpacking a FlagType in MsgFlagUpdate on
  client in Rabbit game. The reported message buffer address was bad (ie
  0xbfffd7ed) Could we be running off the end of the packet (ie count is
  fubar'ed?) Perhaps add sanity check for not overruning end of buffer.

-- simulation --
- at high frame rates (approx. > 500), isDeadReckoningWrong() often returns true
  when tank is moving at constant speed. This leads to many unnecessary
  MsgPlayerUpdate packets to be sent. Maybe floating point inaccuracies?

  Also, at high frame rates, the position update in BaseLocalPlyer::update
  will be too large, because dt is artificially increased then. In 2_0
  this was fixed by simply skipping the update function. We now have an
  outer loop in playing.cxx (doUpdates) which divides a big dt into a
  number of smaller steps, so the fix must be done differently here.

  The DR problem is probably related to the wrong updates.
  simple fix is just a fps cap.

-- regressions--
- jumping is broken; heigth and direction of jumping affected.

- GM does not seem to lock on reliably (try against a remote client,
  bots work fine)
  
- bullets no longer bounce off the walls in replays
  even when ricochets have been enabled
  
-- documentation --
- doc/guide/NetworkProtocol.xml is not up to date

-- bans --
- The reason why a player got banned is not displayed, only a
  'Server forced disconnection' is displayed. The above
  occures at bantime or when trying to reconnect after a ban.

- a banned registered player that gets added to both the banList and
  idBanList is not listed in the latter on a idbanlist yet prevented
  from joining even after the ban is removed from the banList.
  
-- controls --
- someone broke the key-driving rotational acceleration dampening,
  feels like 1.7 driving again.
  
- Observer movement controls seems to get locked-up in Hunt mode.
  
-- rendering --
- New font system renders tabs (such as those from the /ban command usage)
  as a square, and indents the line as much as 28 characters.
  Example: http://static.bzexcess.com/bzfi1003.png
  
- Font sizes are wrong. For instance, in the Change Video Format menu, the
  columns overlap because the font is too large. In other areas, the font
  defaults to being too small.
  Example: http://static.bzexcess.com/fontsize.png
  Example: http://static.bzexcess.com/bzfi1004.png (Fonts set to auto size)
  
- At low screen resolutions, small text becomes very blurry.
  Example: http://static.bzexcess.com/bzfi1005.png

- Zbuffer flickering with Narrow and Covered animated treads

- some ATI cards get font rendering to have variable alpha values
  on each letter. The gl restate was removed from the font manager.
  It should be put in and tied to a config option that defaults to
  off.
  
- Burrowed tank shadows should be ground clipped
  (the shadow perspective matrix messes with the clip plane?)
  
- Material properties for mesh containers are not adjusted by
  ObstacleModifier, and will not save correctly if using saveFlatFile.
 
- same stipple on teleporters and phantom zone, making phatom
   tank behind teleporter virtually invisible when blending is off.

- line stipple doesn't (can't) match polygon stipple
   messes up shadow of flag stem
   
- untextured pause mode, textures only show up while paused when opening menus

- if the display cannot initialize properly, it will start bzflag with a
  black screen.  need to prevent this by either detecting if there is an
  available mode that is possible, lowering memory usage, or reporting
  an error and aborting.
  
 - Flaghelp falls into the radar area when radar is 'bigger'

-- build system --
- make maintainer-clean does not enter DIST_SUBDIRS
  so all Makefile.in and Makefile files are not removed correctly
  (this is probably a bug in automake 1.4, not in our files)
  
- build system for bzrobots is not happy.

- many warnings that are treated as errors on 64bit GCC builds 
  (lots of format issues).

-- platform (multiple) --
- Shift+Tab seems to be bound to jump without being bound to jump
  It doesn't happen on Linux. Shift+Tab action is untranslated by XLookupString
  (xfree86 4.3), so need custom code to go into bzflag.
  
-- platform (windows) --
- not blanking screen during win32 startup
   should black out screen before changing resolutions
   should raise on top of task bar
   also black out screen when quitting until resolution restored

- error dialogs on win32 may appear off screen
   only when display resolution was changed
   
- jitter on windows servers is reported as very high, but play
  is unaffected.
  
- Windows BZFS will not let clients connect when 'too many' flags
  are specified.

- Two seperate boxen, windows build with vc8, nvidia vid cards.
  When jumping on box "name Box - position 250 250 118 - rotation 0
   - size 15 15 0.1 - end" on my WarTowers map, the one with the
  transporter on it, tanks stick to the box and lock coming through 
  the transporter on the ground linked to that transporter on that 
  box. Screenshot available on request. Linux clients on two boxen
  do not have this issue. 
  PS:
  This differs from the latter "teleporting is blocking" bug in 
  misc directory further down this list in that the sky teleport is
  on regular box, not mesh, and it localized the bug to windows 
  builds currently. But could obviously be related.
  @ r16889 -spldart-
   
-- platform (SDL) --
- if you start the client windowed on a multidisplay system, and then
  move the window to a secondary monitor, you cannot control the
  brightness of the (SDL) window since it's presently modifying the
  gamma of the display that started it.

-- platform (X11) --

-- platform (OSX) --
- Reported lockup on OSX when swapping from fullscreen to windowed mode(ts)

-- bzfs --
- ANSI codes can be used in the server -public messages
  The best solution is probably to strip the codes at the listserver
  
- bzfs sometimes gets into a mode where CTF team flags spawn at random places,
  not on bases.  Also, players spawn at random spots after flag cap.

- Have flag spawn zones set in 2.0.x world. Same world in trunk produces an 
  "Unable to position flags on this world." for each zone specified by world.
  However I have the zoned flags appearing to be in the places I specified.
  Message origin? Screenshot available if needed. -spldart-
  
- maxPlayers is a lie.  See WorldBuilder.cxx:237 and bzfsClientMessages.cxx:39.

- Too many flags caused "drop, unresponsive with 16687 bytes queued"
  (+f good{40} was the breaking point, linux, local bzfs server)
  admittedly, an unreasonable number of flags
  
- Bad BZDB: some BZDB variables are not range checked:
  "/set _syncTime -" goes boom on the client side.
  (StateDatabase::ExpressionToken::operator=, StateDatabase.cxx:890)

-- Gameplay --
- not dropping a flag grabbed just before being destroyed

- the last shot fired with a shot-limited flag doesn't carry the flag
  type (or is dropped by the server?)...e.g. if I have G, limited to
  5 shots, and kill someone with the fifth shot, only that player dies
  because the flag was dropped by the time the kill was scored...
  even though the shot was fired while I still had the flag.
 
- dropping a team flag, when the related team is empty, start a timeout.
  The related code does not take into account that we can have now
  multiple team flags.
  
- teleporting is blocking when going from a ground teleporter to
  a teleporter sitting on a mesh object. fix during next protocol
  breakage  (workaround by dropping the ground teleporter by a
  small amount... causing the burrow sound)
  
- shooting straight shots with the Agility flag while just having accelerated
  forward (common tactic to shoot "fast shots") will miss targets that are
  rather stationary and directly in the shot's path.
  
- bullets now travel through the top of a block instead of reflecting off.
  The bullets appear to be half(or more) submerged into the block.
  
- world weapons seem to lag the server when there are many players joined.
  might be related to a rapidly repeating world weapon as well (like once
  a second, use _weapons BZDB var to test...)

-- 3rd party libs --
- if there is a network connection (e.g. a lan) yet no external
  access, the client hangs hard in cURLManager.cxx:291 and later in
  some odd corrupted stack space elsewhere.  this was with CURL 7.13.1
  (default Mac libcurl).  simple workaround is to invoke client with
  -list e://localhost (even if no local server is running) to avoid
  the hang on resolving.

-- services --
- list server includes counts for players running on non-public/mis-configured
  servers on the same machine on different ports.  if server runs on port 5156
  with publicaddr set to machine:5156 and then also runs another on 59999 with
  publicaddr set to machine:5156 (by accident or otherwise), then player joins
  to the 59999 server mask the 5156 server.  it'd be easy to blow this off as
  expected behavior, but I expect one can also trojan any server's counts
  using this same technique..
  
-- tools --
- bzadmin seems to be less responsive over the network than bzflag - a
  bzadmin client can get kicked from a very active game by the server
  for causing it to queue too many packages (there's a limit at 20kB, when I
  removed it the queue went up to at least 64kB)

-- Dubious --
- can sometimes appear in front of bad guys
