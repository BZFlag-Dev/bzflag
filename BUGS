critical bugs
-------------

- bzc file writing seems to be goofy. Some bindings are never written into
  the file, and some get written more than once. [I have two bind lines for
  the same key]  there is trouble remapping the Ident"ify/Respawn" key from
  "right mouse or i" to something else.  tried remapping to "w" during
  gameplay and it fails for  windows and os x.  also fails to respawn with
  right mouse if you try to change the setting during  game.  the values do
  not appear to be persistent properly either (quit and return and it's
  displayed wrong).  resetting key map doesn't seem to fully erase the current
  bindings before reapplying defaults (same bug as above?)

- Sometimes when you pick up MG, the tank automatically, and constantly
  starts firing all the shots over and over. Seen on Mac and Windows.  Happens
  every time on the mac client.

- Reported that sometimes you get stuck trying to respawn (You don't respawn). 
  It's reported that it happens to a group of players at roughly the same time 
  at a certain time during the game.
  If this only happened when players were killed without getting shot at
  (G, SR, selfdestruct etc) it has been fixed now, if it happens again 
  there is another bug somewhere.

recent bugs
------------

- Flaghelp falls into the radar area when radar is 'bigger'

- Address Exception reported when unpacking a FlagType in MsgFlagUpdate on
  client in Rabbit game. The reported message buffer address was bad (ie
  0xbfffd7ed) Could we be running off the end of the packet (ie count is
  fubar'ed?) Perhaps add sanity check for not overruning end of buffer.

- On a FFA game, where no purple was allowed a Team size of 65535 was displayed
  for Purple.

- Rabbit selection is borken. Two things. A player often is Rabbit two times
  in a row, which was intended to be illegal, and high scoring tanks get
  bypassed.  Was playing on ducati where a player was consistantly in #1 slot,
  but NEVER was rabbit. (The latter probaby happens when all players have a
  negative score, the formula does not work well then). Nope: Top player was
  44-31 or there abouts. HMM. I played again and the picking was fine. Could it
  be a cheat client, causing havoc?

- bzadmin seems to be less responsive over the network than bzflag - a
  bzadmin client can get kicked from a very active game by the server
  for causing it to queue too many packages (there's a limit at 20kB, when I
  removed it the queue went up to at least 64kB)

- Player continues to see the locked on me message after death until
  shooter locked onto a different target. (Nidhoggr reported this)

- Killed tanks continue drifting and leave tank bits floating around on the
  modified gravity ducati.  players seem to continue forwarding after landing
  until X time as if gravity was unchanged.

- Observer controls get confused sometimes. To see, push control and arrows
  to spin. While keys are down, push alt. Now release all. You continue spinning
  un aided. Now stop yourself. Now alt doesn't work. Bagheera reports he gets
  into situations where movement is out of control.

- os x client audio is very choppy when the user has a sound card installed

- bzfs should re-resolve the list server IP if it can't reach it for an update

- make maintainer-clean does not enter DIST_SUBDIRS
  so all Makefile.in and Makefile files are not removed correctly
  (this is probably a bug in automake 1.4, not in our files)

* exploding tank parts sometimes move along the ground instead of
   flying up into the air.

* not dropping a flag grabbed just before being destroyed

* same stipple on teleporters and phantom zone, making phatom
   tank behind teleporter virtually invisible when blending is off.

* not drawing back to front when depth buffer is on:
   flag edges can't be antialiased right
   teleporter blended on top of shots in front of them

* line stipple doesn't (can't) match polygon stipple
   messes up shadow of flag stem

* can sometimes appear in front of bad guys

* some linux systems get XIO error on startup
   no idea why but it's consistent on those systems
   (probably XIJoystick code?)

* not blanking screen during win32 startup
   should black out screen before changing resolutions
   should raise on top of task bar
   also black out screen when quitting until resolution restored

* error dialogs on win32 may appear off screen
   only when display resolution was changed
