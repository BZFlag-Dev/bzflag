recent bugs
------------

- when burrowed, the ground gets chopped off by the near clip plane, leaving
  the bottom 1/3 of the screen or so with artifacts

- tanks only check their bottoms as regards hit detection against pyramids

- resetting key map doesn't seem to fully erase the current bindings before
  reapplying defaults

- src/bzflag/ShotStrategy.cxx SegmentedShotStrategy::makeSegments will not
  handle shots that bounce 'down', it presenly ends them. it should make
  them bounce when they hit the gound.

- make maintainer-clean does not enter DIST_SUBDIRS
  so all Makefile.in and Makefile files are not removed correctly

* exploding tank parts sometimes move along the ground instead of
   flying up into the air.

* not dropping a flag grabbed just before being destroyed

* same stipple on teleporters and phantom zone, making phatom
   tank behind teleporter virtually invisible when blending is off.

* hit detection on pyramids computed at altitude of ray origin

* not drawing back to front when depth buffer is on:
   flag edges can't be antialiased right
   teleporter blended on top of shots in front of them

* line stipple doesn't (can't) match polygon stipple
   messes up shadow of flag stem

* can sometimes appear in front of bad guys

* some linux systems get XIO error on startup
   no idea why but it's consistent on those systems
   (probably XIJoystick code?)

* not blanking screen during win32 startup
   should black out screen before changing resolutions
   should raise on top of task bar
   also black out screen when quitting until resolution restored

* error dialogs on win32 may appear off screen
   only when display resolution was changed

* collision problems
   can sometimes get stuck on a pyramid or in a corner.  also
   picking up the obese flag close to a building can cause you
   to get stuck.

* robots are just too stupid

* robots can sometimes go through buildings
   the code to generate the cells of open space are susceptible
   to roundoff error, causing an open cell inside a building.
