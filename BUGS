recent bugs
------------

- players gets stuck for no reason, can move or turn, but can shoot
  so far only seen it in ctf mode, happened twice on pop in at base
  xmission

- bzfs should re-resolve the list server IP if it can't reach it for an update

- OS X client gamma on a secondary display set as main display uses the wrong
  gamma (very very dark); brightness is set incorrectly.

- Shots that bounce off the ground occasionally reflect in the wrong
  direction - x/y flipped

- tanks only check their bottoms as regards hit detection against pyramids

- resetting key map doesn't seem to fully erase the current bindings before
  reapplying defaults

- make maintainer-clean does not enter DIST_SUBDIRS
  so all Makefile.in and Makefile files are not removed correctly

- bzfls seems not to talk the new protocol correctly when testing server:
  1.9: Player [0] accept() from 208.186.182.172:53438 on 6
       Player  [0] on 6 removed: ECONNRESET/EPIPE

  1.7: Player [0] accept() from 208.186.182.172:53470 on 7
       Player [0] shutdownAcceptClient: close(7)

- team tag was added to shots to calculate team kills correctly when players
  change teams (rabbit mode); this does nto really seem to be used or thought through
  so far (apart from printing a different message when one gets shot); without
  having digged any depper it looks like we would add team id inforamtion to
  MsgKilled, too.

older bugs in BZFlag
--------------------

see the bug tracker on SourceForge for more
http://SourceForge.net/tracker/?group_id=3248&atid=103248

* exploding tank parts sometimes move along the ground instead of
   flying up into the air.

* not dropping a flag grabbed just before being destroyed

* same stipple on teleporters and phantom zone, making phatom
   tank behind teleporter virtually invisible when blending is off.

* hit detection on pyramids computed at altitude of ray origin

* not drawing back to front when depth buffer is on:
   flag edges can't be antialiased right
   teleporter blended on top of shots in front of them

* line stipple doesn't (can't) match polygon stipple
   messes up shadow of flag stem

* can sometimes appear in front of bad guys

* some linux systems get XIO error on startup
   no idea why but it's consistent on those systems
   (probably XIJoystick code?)

* not blanking screen during win32 startup
   should black out screen before changing resolutions
   should raise on top of task bar
   also black out screen when quitting until resolution restored

* error dialogs on win32 may appear off screen
   only when display resolution was changed

* collision problems
   can sometimes get stuck on a pyramid or in a corner.  also
   picking up the obese flag close to a building can cause you
   to get stuck.
