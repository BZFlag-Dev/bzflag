BZFlag Bugs
===========

Users should report bugs to our bug tracker on the project website at
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=3248&atid=103248

The bugs and issues listed in this file may or may not be the same as or related
to the bugs reported to the bug tracker.  In general, users should not look to
this file for information regarding the status of bugs.  The BUGS file contains
informal bug-related information that is intended only as notes for developers.
This may include short term issues that are in active development as well as
long term and on-going issues.  These notes are completely independent of any
bugs formally reported on the bug tracker.

Crashes
-------

* Tanks only spawn at ground level. Complex maps that have tunnels or platforms
  may not like this (spawn out of bounds happens)

* reached assertion on either World::getTeleportTarget() or
  World::getTeleporter() after getting killed while jumping towards a teleporter
  (and landing in front of the teleporter, albeit dead).  i didn't respawn,
  waited a couple sec (was chatting), then the assertion was raised.

* Address Exception reported when unpacking a FlagType in MsgFlagUpdate on
  client in Rabbit game. The reported message buffer address was bad (ie
  0xbfffd7ed) Could we be running off the end of the packet (ie count is
  fubar'ed?) Perhaps add sanity check for not overruning end of buffer.

* Creating a new tab in the server list: appending to the end of an existing
  field, instead of deleting it causes a crash. There's an extremely sketchy
  calculation in HUDuiTypeIn.cxx line 175 that results in a std::out_of_range
  exception on line 181

* The WebAdmin plugin segfaults the server on shutdown.

* After joining then leaving a server with at least one solo bot, the bzfs
  will crash reasonably predictably at NetHandler:578 (toBeKickedReason is a
  bad ptr) This happens at least on Windows
  
Regressions
-----------

* Some players hear clicks and pops with sound effects, others do not.
  Sounds cause an observable reduction in frame rate.

* GM does not seem to lock on reliably (try against a remote client, bots work
  fine)

* server communication error when someone logs off and people are still playing
  (may be fixed as of 2.99.21)

Documentation
-------------

* doc/guide/NetworkProtocol.xml is not up to date

Bans
----

* a banned registered player that gets added to both the banList and idBanList
  is not listed in the latter on a idbanlist yet prevented from joining even
  after the ban is removed from the banList.

Controls
--------

* someone broke the key-driving rotational acceleration dampening, feels like
  1.7 driving again.

* Observer movement controls seems to get locked-up in Hunt mode.

Rendering
---------

* turning off texturing screws up the menu icon

* Tab rendering on the control panel is braindead.  Probably should use some
  kind of begin/end tabular data markers across multiple messages and line up
  the columns based on that.

* At low screen resolutions, small text becomes very blurry.  Example:
  http://static.bzexcess.com/bzfi1005.png

* When using the Vera Mono Bold font at size 24 the following 5 characters are
  invisible on the screen: $j{|}  A suitable replacement for
  data/fonts/VeraMonoBold.ttf should solve this.

* Zbuffer flickering with Narrow and Covered animated treads

* some ATI cards get font rendering to have variable alpha values on each
  letter. The gl restate was removed from the font manager.  It should be put in
  and tied to a config option that defaults to off.

* Burrowed tank shadows should be ground clipped (the shadow perspective matrix
  messes with the clip plane?)

* Material properties for mesh containers are not adjusted by ObstacleModifier,
  and will not save correctly if using saveFlatFile.

* same stipple on teleporters and phantom zone, making phatom tank behind
   teleporter virtually invisible when blending is off.

* line stipple doesn't (can't) match polygon stipple messes up shadow of flag
  stem

* if the display cannot initialize properly, it will start bzflag with a black
  screen.  need to prevent this by either detecting if there is an available
  mode that is possible, lowering memory usage, or reporting an error and
  aborting.

* Flaghelp falls into the radar area when radar is 'bigger'

* When setting resolution to 1400x1050 ~ 1920x1080 the font listing the various
  resolutions overlaps one another. @ r18096 -spldart-
  -confirmed- @ r19553

* Navigating the server list jumps around.  Join->Find Server then press the
  down arrow repeatedly (for the All tab).  The highlighted server list item
  jumps around instead of going sequentially through the servers.  Hitting
  return to select a server doesn't load the highlighted server.

Replay
------

* Recorded bots seem to be 'stucked' in replay.

Platform (multiple)
-------------------

* Shift+Tab seems to be bound to jump without being bound to jump It doesn't
  happen on Linux. Shift+Tab action is untranslated by XLookupString (xfree86
  4.3), so need custom code to go into bzflag.

Platform (Windows)
------------------

* not blanking screen during win32 startup should black out screen before
  changing resolutions should raise on top of task bar also black out screen
  when quitting until resolution restored

- error dialogs on win32 may appear off screen
   only when display resolution was changed

* jitter on windows servers is reported as very high, but play is unaffected.

* Two separate boxen, windows build with vc8 (VC9), nvidia vid cards. (ATI)

  When jumping on box "name Box - position 250 250 118 - rotation 0 - size 15 15
  0.1 - end" on my WarTowers map, the one with the transporter on it, tanks
  stick to the box and lock coming through the transporter on the ground linked
  to that transporter on that box. Screenshot available on request. Linux
  clients on two boxen do not have this issue.

  PS: This differs from the latter "teleporting is blocking" bug in misc
  directory further down this list in that the sky teleport is on regular box,
  not mesh, and it localized the bug to windows builds currently. But could
  obviously be related.  @ r16889 -spldart- (r19553) ()<- recent retest.


bzfs
----

* After about 28 minutes with 4 players on the map there was an unexplained
  minute of everyone rapidly toggling between NR and okay.  Chat messages were
  queued and delivered to the server after things returned to normal.  Lag
  numbers were very high (up to 1.3 seconds) right after this.

* After nearly an hour of playing bzfs provided a new random map to rejoiners,
  while the player who stayed was on the original random map.  Each player was
  seen interacting with their own map.  Very confusing.

* bzfs sometimes gets into a mode where CTF team flags spawn at random places,
  not on bases.  Also, players spawn at random spots after flag cap.

* maxPlayers is a lie.  See WorldBuilder.cxx:237 and bzfsClientMessages.cxx:39.

Gameplay
--------

* the last shot fired with a shot-limited flag doesn't carry the flag type (or
  is dropped by the server?)...e.g. if I have G, limited to 5 shots, and kill
  someone with the fifth shot, only that player dies because the flag was
  dropped by the time the kill was scored...  even though the shot was fired
  while I still had the flag (may be fixed: remove this item if you can
  confirm).

* dropping a team flag, when the related team is empty, start a timeout.  The
  related code does not take into account that we can have now multiple team
  flags.

* teleporting is blocking when going from a ground teleporter to a teleporter
  sitting on a mesh object. fix during next protocol breakage (workaround by
  dropping the ground teleporter by a small amount... causing the burrow sound)

* shooting straight shots with the Agility flag while just having accelerated
  forward (common tactic to shoot "fast shots") will miss targets that are
  rather stationary and directly in the shot's path.

* world weapons seem to lag the server when there are many players joined.
  might be related to a rapidly repeating world weapon as well (like once a
  second, use _weapons BZDB var to test...)

Solo Bots
--------------

* Under Windows, bots shots are currently exploding as soon as they are fired.
  this is a pretty recent development, probably some time July '09

3rd party libs
--------------

* if there is a network connection (e.g. a lan) yet no external access, the
  client hangs hard in cURLManager.cxx:291 and later in some odd corrupted stack
  space elsewhere.  this was with CURL 7.13.1 (default Mac libcurl).  simple
  workaround is to invoke client with -list e://localhost (even if no local
  server is running) to avoid the hang on resolving.

Services
--------

* list server includes counts for players running on non-public/mis-configured
  servers on the same machine on different ports.  if server runs on port 5156
  with publicaddr set to machine:5156 and then also runs another on 59999 with
  publicaddr set to machine:5156 (by accident or otherwise), then player joins
  to the 59999 server mask the 5156 server.  it'd be easy to blow this off as
  expected behavior, but I expect one can also trojan any server's counts using
  this same technique..

Tools
-----

* bzadmin seems to be less responsive over the network than bzflag - a bzadmin
  client can get kicked from a very active game by the server for causing it to
  queue too many packages (there's a limit at 20kB, when I removed it the queue
  went up to at least 64kB)
