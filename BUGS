recent bugs
------------

- 1.9.3 client was able to connect to 1.9.7 server.. odd behavior ensued,
  server tried to kick and fails to find the player. server iterates over
  player ids and it looks like it skips the id of the player to be kicked.

- players gets stuck for no reason, can't move or turn, but can shoot.
  Seen on xmission (CTF), also seen on brlcad (FFA). Was stuck after each respawn,
  could jump vertically, sometimes, but could shoot. Had to restart client toget unstuck.
  This happened 10/14 again. base respawn.
  Is it possible we are respawning IN the base by accident sometimes?

- Can only see flag and lights of thief tank

- bzfs should re-resolve the list server IP if it can't reach it for an update

- Shots that bounce off the ground occasionally reflect in the wrong
  direction - x/y flipped
  Actually i think sometimes the bullet misses the bounce against the ground
  and travels unabatted downward, making it look like an odd angle.

- tanks only check their bottoms as regards hit detection against pyramids
  Corollary, if you drop burrow while under pyr, you get stuck, not unlike
  grabbing obese next to a building.

- resetting key map doesn't seem to fully erase the current bindings before
  reapplying defaults

- make maintainer-clean does not enter DIST_SUBDIRS
  so all Makefile.in and Makefile files are not removed correctly

- bzfls seems not to talk the new protocol correctly when testing server:
  1.9: Player [0] accept() from 208.186.182.172:53438 on 6
       Player  [0] on 6 removed: ECONNRESET/EPIPE

  1.7: Player [0] accept() from 208.186.182.172:53470 on 7
       Player [0] shutdownAcceptClient: close(7)

- team tag was added to shots to calculate team kills correctly when players
  change teams (rabbit mode); this does nto really seem to be used or thought through
  so far (apart from printing a different message when one gets shot); without
  having digged any depper it looks like we would add team id inforamtion to
  MsgKilled, too.

older bugs in BZFlag
--------------------

see the bug tracker on SourceForge for more
http://SourceForge.net/tracker/?group_id=3248&atid=103248

* exploding tank parts sometimes move along the ground instead of
   flying up into the air.

* not dropping a flag grabbed just before being destroyed

* same stipple on teleporters and phantom zone, making phatom
   tank behind teleporter virtually invisible when blending is off.

* hit detection on pyramids computed at altitude of ray origin

* not drawing back to front when depth buffer is on:
   flag edges can't be antialiased right
   teleporter blended on top of shots in front of them

* line stipple doesn't (can't) match polygon stipple
   messes up shadow of flag stem

* can sometimes appear in front of bad guys

* some linux systems get XIO error on startup
   no idea why but it's consistent on those systems
   (probably XIJoystick code?)

* not blanking screen during win32 startup
   should black out screen before changing resolutions
   should raise on top of task bar
   also black out screen when quitting until resolution restored

* error dialogs on win32 may appear off screen
   only when display resolution was changed

* collision problems
   can sometimes get stuck on a pyramid or in a corner.  also
   picking up the obese flag close to a building can cause you
   to get stuck.
