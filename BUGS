recent bugs
------------
- The new explode code? LocalPlayer 1.9.8 (i think) is causing too high kicks
  To dup: play in a completely empty world. (no buildings)
  with no jumping. When you explode, you will be kicked

- new list server takes way too long (3-5 seconds) to respond.
  Taking some measurement from receiving request to sending result:
  bzfls.pl on Tim's     : 1.8 sec
  bzflsMy.php on brlcad : 0.3 sec
  bzflsLite on brlcad   : 0.3 sec

- os x client audio is very choppy when the user has a sound card installed

- trouble remapping the "Identify/Respawn" key from "right mouse or i" to
  something else.  tried remapping to "w" during gameplay and it fails for
  windows and os x.  also fails to respawn with right mouse if you try to
  change the setting during game.  the values do not appear to be persistent
  properly either (quit and return and it's displayed wrong).

- resetting key map doesn't seem to fully erase the current bindings before
  reapplying defaults (same bug as above?)

- Observer controls get confused sometimes. To see, push control and arrows
  to spin. While keys are down, push alt. Now release all. You continue spinning
  un aided. Now stop yourself. Now alt doesn't work. Bagheera reports he gets
  into situations where movement is out of control.

- bzfs should re-resolve the list server IP if it can't reach it for an update

- make maintainer-clean does not enter DIST_SUBDIRS
  so all Makefile.in and Makefile files are not removed correctly
  (this is probably a bug in automake 1.4, not in our files)

* exploding tank parts sometimes move along the ground instead of
   flying up into the air.

* not dropping a flag grabbed just before being destroyed

* same stipple on teleporters and phantom zone, making phatom
   tank behind teleporter virtually invisible when blending is off.

* not drawing back to front when depth buffer is on:
   flag edges can't be antialiased right
   teleporter blended on top of shots in front of them

* line stipple doesn't (can't) match polygon stipple
   messes up shadow of flag stem

* can sometimes appear in front of bad guys

* some linux systems get XIO error on startup
   no idea why but it's consistent on those systems
   (probably XIJoystick code?)

* not blanking screen during win32 startup
   should black out screen before changing resolutions
   should raise on top of task bar
   also black out screen when quitting until resolution restored

* error dialogs on win32 may appear off screen
   only when display resolution was changed
