recent bugs
------------

- spin inversion bug, fix in MeshTransform.cxx (around line 300)
  during the next protocol breakage

- do all Riva128 systems require "noMeshClusers"? Is there a 
  workaround to make vertex array work on those cards?

- team flags will not sit on buildings if the -fb option is used
  (bzfs.cxx / line 2708) should the team flags always be allowed
  to land on any valid surface? (no -fb check, no -j check, etc)

  Me (Tupone) like this way without -fb option: flag lands as with -fb. If
  it is a team flag and flag lands on his base it is ok.
  If it lands on any other object just let it disappear unless is a team flag
  where it goes on safety point.

- Mac/SDL client will not process keyboard input if started on the
  command-line with -window instead of going through the Finder.

- Mac OS X client sometimes (50/50) seems to now start to a black
  screen (only the console tab tabs render).  must be recent..

- teleporters ricochet on the frame seems incorrect

- GM and SW flags occasionally do not show in the scoreboard:
  - right clicking still shows the correct flag
  - seemed to track a specific player (not slot or team)
  - the player in question was the only one with an email specified

- sometimes players will receive the message "So-and-so destroyed by server"
  instead of "So-and-so killed by such-and-such".  Appears to depend on
  So-and-so's player slot.

- Too many flags caused "drop, unresponsive with 16687 bytes queued"
  (+f good{40} was the breaking point, linux, local bzfs server)
  admittedly, an unreasonable number of flags

- Bad BZDB: "/set _syncTime -" goes boom on the client side.
  (StateDatabase::ExpressionToken::operator=, StateDatabase.cxx:890)

- Material properties for mesh containers are not adjusted by
  ObstacleModifier, and will not save correctly if using saveFlatFile.

- Observer movement controls seems to get locked-up in Hunt mode.

- Sometimes letters can go missing from the status line of the HUD.
  Like "Cloaking" turning into "loaking", "Brad2901" turning into "rad"
  Alignment is correct for the new strings (e.g. "loaking" is centered)
  so it's not just a rendering problem. Only observed on VC builds.
  Seems to be rather erratic also, but I've heard it from at least four
  people and one sent me a screenshot.

- Record/Replay does not immediately reassign flags to players after a
  state reset, you have to wait until the first MsgGrabFlag.

- Burrowed tank shadows should be ground clipped
  (the shadow perspective matrix messes with the clip plane?)

- if you start the client windowed on a multidisplay system, and then
  move the window to a secondary monitor, you cannot control the
  brightness of the (SDL) window since it presently modifying the
  gamma of the display that started it.

- player score doesn't seem to match the server's score when relaying to
  other players.  i.e. the local client see's their own player score that
  is different from what others see (due to differences in tk).  seems like
  tk is not included in score locally, but is in the server.

- dropping a team flag, when the related team is empty, start a timeout.
  The related code does not take into account that we can have now
  multiple team flags.

- if the display cannot initialize properly, it will start bzflag with a
  black screen.  need to prevent this by either detecting if there is an
  available mode that is possible, lowering memory usage, or reporting
  an error and aborting.

- XIJoystick does not compile

- time limiter does not take jumping into consideration when holding Agility

- shooting straight shots with the Agility flag while just having accelerated
  forward (common tactic to shoot "fast shots") will miss targets that are
  rather stationary and directly in the shot's path.

- bullets now travel through the top of a block instead of reflecting off.
  The bullets appear to be half(or more) submerged into the block.

- world weapons seem to lag the server when there are many players joined.
  might be related to a rapidly repeating world weapon as well (like once
  a second, use _weapons BZDB var to test...)

- reached assertion on either World::getTeleportTarget() or
  World::getTeleporter() after getting killed while jumping towards a
  teleporter (and landing in front of the teleporter, albeit dead).  i
  didn't respawn, waited a couple sec (was chatting), then the assertion was
  raised.

- list server includes counts for players running on non-public/mis-configured
  servers on the same machine on different ports.  if server runs on port 5156
  with publicaddr set to machine:5156 and then also runs another on 59999 with
  publicaddr set to machine:5156 (by accident or otherwise), then player joins
  to the 59999 server mask the 5156 server.  it'd be easy to blow this off as
  expected behavior, but I expect one can also trojan any server's counts
  using this same technique..

- client crashes upon receipt of a corrupted MsgFlagUpdate message.
  (See http://bzflag.secretplace.us/packet.txt for an example)

- doc/guide/NetworkProtocol.xml is not up to date

- Shift+Tab seems to be bound to jump without being bound to jump
  It doesn't happen on Linux. Shift+Tab action is untranslated by XLookupString
  (xfree86 4.3), so need custom code to go into bzflag.

- Flaghelp falls into the radar area when radar is 'bigger'

- Address Exception reported when unpacking a FlagType in MsgFlagUpdate on
  client in Rabbit game. The reported message buffer address was bad (ie
  0xbfffd7ed) Could we be running off the end of the packet (ie count is
  fubar'ed?) Perhaps add sanity check for not overruning end of buffer.

- bzadmin seems to be less responsive over the network than bzflag - a
  bzadmin client can get kicked from a very active game by the server
  for causing it to queue too many packages (there's a limit at 20kB, when I
  removed it the queue went up to at least 64kB)

- make maintainer-clean does not enter DIST_SUBDIRS
  so all Makefile.in and Makefile files are not removed correctly
  (this is probably a bug in automake 1.4, not in our files)

older bugs in BZFlag
---------------------

* exploding tank parts sometimes move along the ground instead of
   flying up into the air.

* not dropping a flag grabbed just before being destroyed

* same stipple on teleporters and phantom zone, making phatom
   tank behind teleporter virtually invisible when blending is off.

* not drawing back to front when depth buffer is on:
   flag edges can't be antialiased right
   teleporter blended on top of shots in front of them

* line stipple doesn't (can't) match polygon stipple
   messes up shadow of flag stem

* can sometimes appear in front of bad guys

* some linux systems get XIO error on startup
   no idea why but it's consistent on those systems
   (probably XIJoystick code?)

* not blanking screen during win32 startup
   should black out screen before changing resolutions
   should raise on top of task bar
   also black out screen when quitting until resolution restored

* error dialogs on win32 may appear off screen
   only when display resolution was changed
