Description: multiplayer multiplatform on-line 3D tank battle game
DescDetail: <<
BZFlag is a 3D multi-player multi-platform tank battle game that
allows users to play against each other in a network environment.
Teams play against each other in a variety of game styles including
capture-the-flag, free-for-all, rabbit hunt, and more.  Destroying a
player on another team scores a win while being destroyed or
destroying a teammate scores a loss.  Rogues have no teammates (not
even other rogues).

The object of capture the flag is to bring an enemy's flag to your
team base.  The objective of free for all is to simply get as high a
score as possible.  Have fun, play fair. ;)
