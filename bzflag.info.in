Description: 3D multiplayer multiplatform tank battle game
DescDetail: <<
BZFlag is a 3D multi-player multi-platform tank battle game that
allows users to play against each other in a network environment.
Teams play against each other in a variety of game styles including
capture-the-flag, free-for-all, rabbit hunt, and more.  It runs on
IRIX, Linux, *BSD, Windows, Mac OS X, and other platforms.  It's
one of the most popular games ever on Silicon Graphics machines.

The object of capture the flag is to bring an enemy's flag to your
team base.  The objective of free for all is to simply get as high a
score as possible.  Destroying a player on another team scores a win
while being destroyed or destroying a teammate scores a loss.  Rogues
have no teammates (not even other rogues).

Have fun, play fair. ;)

---[ Installation ]---------------------------------------------------

Installing "bzflag" will compile and install of the BZFlag application
binaries including the bzflag, bzfs, & bzadmin.  Please report any
failures to fink@bzflag.bz with the subject "BZFlag Fink Build" and
a log of the entire build and any errors shown.

---[ Startup ]--------------------------------------------------------

Presently, there is no fink support for the X11 version of BZFlag.
If you'd like to make the necessary fink "split" for the info file,
we'll be more than happy to make that happen.  Otherwise, BZFlag will
assume Mac OS X build environment and utilize Aqua and various
frameworks.

If you receive an error about being unable to find the BZFlag data
directory, run:  bzflag -directory /sw/share/bzflag/

---[ Done ]-----------------------------------------------------------

We hope you enjoy the game!  Please feel free to interact with the
BZFlag developers and players on-line if you have any questions,
comments, or run into issues.  Most are available in #bzflag on the
irc.freenode.net IRC network or through the Sourceforge project site
at http://sf.net/projects/bzflag/.

Cheers!
