BZFlag Server Plugin: logDetail
================================================================================

The logDetail plugin displays information about server events in a more
consistent format.  This allows you to more easily write a script to parse the
log output for use in web interfaces or database lookups.

The log detail plugin displays:
* unprocessed user commands (slash commands before they are processed - valid
  or not)
* player reports
* chat messages (broadcasts, team messages, admin channel messages, and
  private messages)
* server messages
* players joining (ip, auth status, team, etc)
* player authentication changes (via /password or /identify)
* players leaving
