we should probably expose a dictionary for the slash commands - just
do something like:
	def callback (player, message):
	    # do something
	    pass
	BZFlag.Commands['blarg'] = callback

BZDB can probably also be exposed as a dictionary

I'm not sure this will actually work. Might require making a custom object
that acts like a dictionary
-----------------------------------------
TODO:

* Some events expect data passed back to them - GetSpawnPos, for instance. Need
  to figure out a way to do this, as well as reconcile the results when we have
  multiple scripts running (probably look at how bzfsAPI reconciles multiple
  results)

* Some events don't seem to have data, like ZoneEntryHandler. Bug Jeff about this.

* Add kw support to events

* Docstrings

* Test events, especially those which have complex argument structures
