the C++ API has two functions for accessing player data:
bz_getPlayerIndexList() and bz_getPlayerByIndex()

this should probably be hidden in the python bindings. i'm sure there's a way
to implement a dictionary where any accesses result in calls back to those
functions. this way, one could index into that dictionary to get the player
object, or iterate over it to just see all players along with their IDs

similarly, we should probably expose a dictionary for the slash commands - just
do something like:
	def callback (player, message):
	    # do something
	    pass
	BZFlag.Commands['blarg'] = callback

BZDB can probably also be exposed as a dictionary

not quite sure yet how to handle events
might want to use another dictionary!
	BZFlag.Events[BZFlag.Event.Tick].append (callback)
