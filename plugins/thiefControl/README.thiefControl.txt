    DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARY : thiefControl Project Overview
========================================================================

This is the thiefControl plugin, which causes players to drop their
Thief flag if they attempt to steal a flag from a teammate.
Exceptions:

* rogue players may steal flags from each other as usual
* non-rogue players may steal team flags from teammates for quick
  movement across the battlefield
