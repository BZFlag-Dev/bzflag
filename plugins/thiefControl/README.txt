========================================================================

This is the thiefControl plugin.  It prevents players from stealing
from teammates.

When a player attempts to steal a flag from a teammate the plugin
cancels the action and drops the Thief flag the stealer is carrying.
The plugin sends a message to the thief when the THief flag is dropped.
