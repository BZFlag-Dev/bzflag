    DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARY : SAMPLE_PLUGIN Project Overview
========================================================================

This is the SAMPLE_PLUGIN plugin.

Replace every occurrence of the term SAMPLE_PLUGIN in every file in here
with the name of your project.  Also open .sln and .vcproj files in a
text editor and do a search and replace.  Then write a short readme with
usage instructions or other details in this file. If you did not use the
newplug.sh script to create this directory, add the appropriate entries
to configure.ac and plugins/Makefile.am. The plugin will have to be
manually added to the mac Xcode project.


The sample plugin is licensed differently then the rest of the project.
It is released under the BSD 2 clause license so that plug-in developer can
use whatever license they want instead of being forced to use LGPL.
