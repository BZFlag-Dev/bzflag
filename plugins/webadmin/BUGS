webadmin bugs
=============

Note: These issues affect the functionality of the webadmin plugin,
but may be the result of errors in other parts of the server.

* Session cookies are never sent to the client.
  This should be fixed ASAP, since it prevents functionality testing.

* [$CurrentPage] and [$UserName] are not properly substituted.

* main page stops output at the beginning of the <ul> for players.
