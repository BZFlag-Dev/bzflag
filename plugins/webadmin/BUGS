webadmin bugs
=============

Note: These issues affect the functionality of the webadmin plugin,
but may be the result of errors in other parts of the server.

* [$CurrentPage] is not properly replaced in the header.

* logging out from webadmin is supposed to redirect to main page,
  but instead produces no reply.

* When submitting the main page form, SIGSEGV occurs in HTTPServer
  at either line 414 or 428.

* When submitting the group page form, SIGABRT is thrown.
