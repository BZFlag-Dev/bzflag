    DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARY : RogueGenocide Project Overview
========================================================================

This is the RogueGenocide plugin.  It causes all of the spawned rogue
players to die if one of them is hit by a Genocide shot, just as if
they were all on the same team.  A rogue player firing such a shot
will die, too.
