    DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARY : serverSidePlayerSample Project Overview
========================================================================

This is the serverSidePlayerSample plugin.

Replace every occurrence of the term serverSidePlayerSample in every file in here
with the name of your project.  Also open .sln and .vcproj files in a
text editor and do a search and replace.  Then write a short readme with
usage instructions or other details in this file. If you did not use the
newplug.sh script to create this directory, add the appropriate entries
to configure.ac and plugins/Makefile.am. The plugin will have to be
manually added to the mac Xcode project.
