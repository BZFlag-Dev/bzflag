  # Ban File Section
  # ----------------
  # Ban files can be shared between multiple servers.  Specify the location for
  # the shared banfile. The plugin checks the modification time for the file
  # approximately every 3 seconds and reloads the ban file if it has changed.

  # This is the relative or absolute location of the main ban file.
  BanFile = db/banfile

  # Message to display when bans are reloaded.
  BanReloadMessage = Bans updated

  # This is the relative or absolute location of the local copy of the
  # masterbans file.
  MasterBanFile = db/master-bans.txt

  # Message to display when the master ban list is reloaded.
  MasterBanReloadMessage = Master bans updated

  #
  # Server Restart Section
  # ----------------------
  #
  # If you run your BZFlag server in a server loop from a shell script you can
  # force the server to exit so the server can be reloaded by the controlling
  # shell script.
  #
  # The plugin causes the server to shutdown if the server was active and has
  # zero players.  A server is considered active if at least one non-observer
  # player has connected to the server.  This can be used to change maps, reset
  # the server back to its default settings, etc.

  # The ResetServerOnceFile normally does not exist.  You create this file when
  # you want to force a server reset.  You can do this on busy maps to queue a
  # server shutdown when the game ends without interrupting play.  If this file
  # exists and the server is empty it forces an immediate shutdown regardless of
  # whether the server was active or not.  You would normally use this when you
  # update to a new version of the server or plugin code or change server
  # configuration options and want to restart the server without interrupting
  # any currently running games.  The ResetServerOnceFile is removed when the
  # server is shutdown by the plugin.
  ResetServerOnceFile = reset-server-once

  # If the ResetServerAlwaysFile exists the server will exit each time the last
  # player leaves the server.  The server requires a non-observer to join to put
  # it in an 'active' state before the plugin will cause the server to exit
  # (someone actually has to use the map before the server exits). This can be
  # used to control rotation servers with no time limit.
  ResetServerAlwaysFile = reset-server-always

  # This option will cause the plugin to ignore observers, allowing the server
  # to shut down when all non-observers leave the server.
  #IgnoreObservers = true
