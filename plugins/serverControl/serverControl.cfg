  # Ban File Section
  # ----------------
  # Ban files can be shared between multiple servers.
  # Specify the location for the shared banfile.
  # The plugin checks the modification time for the file
  # every tick event (approximately every 3 seconds) and
  # reloads the banfile information on the server

  # Ban file location
  BanFile = db/banfile
  # Message to display when bans are reloaded.
  BanReloadMessage = Bans updated

  # Local file copy of the master ban
  MasterBanFile = db/master-bans.txt
  # Message to display when the master ban list is reloaded

  # Server Restart Section
  # ----------------------
  #
  # If you run your BZFlag server in a server loop from a shell script
  # you can force the server to exit so the server can be reloaded by
  # the controlling shell script.
  #
  # The plugin causes the server to shutdown if the server was active
  # and has zero players.  A server is considered active if at least
  # one non-observer player has connected to the server.  This can be
  # used to change maps, reset the server back to its default
  # settings, etc.

  # The ResetServerOnceFile normally does not exist.  You create this
  # file when you want to force a server reset.  You can do this on
  # busy maps to queue a server shutdown when the game ends without
  # interrupting play.  If this file exists and the server is empty it
  # forces an immediate shutdown regardless of whether the server was
  # active or not.  You would normally use this when you update to a
  # new version of the server or plugin code or change server
  # configuration options and want to restart the server without
  # interrupting any currently running games.  The ResetServerOnceFile
  # is removed when the server is shutdown by the plugin.
  ResetServerOnceFile = reset-server-once

  # If the ResetServerAlwaysFile exists the server will exit each time
  # the last player leaves the server.  The server requires a
  # non-observer to join to put it in an 'active' state before the
  # plugin will cause the server to exit (someone actually has to use
  # the map before the server exits). This can be used to control
  # rotation servers with no time limit.
  ResetServerAlwaysFile = reset-server-always

  # Ignore observers makes the server shutdown after a non-observer has
  # connected even if observers are still present
  #IgnoreObservers = true
