HoldTheFlag plugin version 1.0.0  (Oct 10, 2005)
------------------------------------------------

HoldTheFlag plugin is a score-tracker for the Hold The Flag game mode.


Plugin command Line:
====================
  -loadplugin PLUGINNAME,[TEAM=teamcolor]

  If a team color is specified on the command-line, only players who join
  that team can play. Players who attempt to join another team color will
  be kicked.

  Example:   -loadplugin HoldTheFlag,team=green



In-game commands:
=================
  /htf:       displays the current scores
  /htf on:    enables htf mode  (enabled by default, requires HTFONOFF permission)
  /htf off:   disables htf mode  (requires HTFONOFF permission)
  /htf reset: reset all htf scores (requires COUNTDOWN permission)


Matches:
========
  The HoldTheFlag plugin understands the normal (/countdown) timed
  match command.  Scores will automatically be displayed whenever
  a player captures a flag, and a winner will be declared at the end
  of the match. An '*' after a player's score indicates the player who
  made the last capture. This is used to break a tie.
