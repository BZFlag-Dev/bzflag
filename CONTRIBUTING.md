# Contributing 
So you want to help with BZFlag development? Good for you. We thrive on the creativity of new developers. Here are a couple of things to help you be effective

## Fork the Project
First, you want to fork your own version of the BZFlag project. To do this, you will need a [github](http::www.github.com) account. Then your will want to fork the [BZFlag](https://github.com/BZFlag-Dev/bzflag) project. Click on the "Fork" button at the top right and fork a copy to your account.

Then you will need to clone your repo to your local machine. From a Unix command line:

    git clone https://github.com/jwmelto/bzflag.git _yourWorkingDir_

Also, add the parent project as an upstream remote:

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/BZFlag-Dev/bzflag.git

Then, make whatever changes you think are useful. As a suggestion, try to create each potential pull request on a separate branch. This will make your PRs more self-contained.

## Create a Pull Request
After you have coded (and tested!) your change, push your changes to your github repo

    git push origin

When your github fork has your changes, click on the "New pull request" button. Please provide enough explanation to help our developers review your change for validity and quality.

That's it. Thanks for your time and effort. We look forward to collaborating with you.
