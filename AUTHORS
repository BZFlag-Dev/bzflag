BZFlag Contributors
===================

The BZFlag development team would like to thank the many people who
have contributed to BZFlag over the years.  The game was initially and
primarily written by Chris Schoeneman in 1992 while he was a Masters
student at the Cornell Program of Computer Graphics.  In 1999, Chris
Schoeneman trasferred copyright and maintainership of the game over to
Tim Riker, whom continues in that role today.  Since the project was
released as open source software around roughly the same time, a
considerable number of other developers and contributors have become a
part of the project as well.

Over the project's lifetime, there have been many contributors to
BZFlag.  Listed below are the various individuals and groups that have
provided their time, energy, and input.  The contributors are
characterized into different groups to indicate the level and type of
involvement with the project: core developers, developers, code
contributors, servers & infrastructure, corporate & organizational
support, and special thanks.  For each section, the contributors are
listed in chronological order with the earliest contributors listed
first.


CORE DEVELOPERS
---------------

Among all the developers are a core set of individuals that have
dedicated themselves to the improvement of the game at some point in
time, making a substantial and sustained impact on the game's
development and on-going maintenance.  If you review the commit logs,
these are the names you will likely see the most.

CODE CONTRIBUTORS
-----------------

Code contributors includes individuals that have made useful yet
limited source code contributions to the game.  The range of
contributions varies greatly here with some providing simple one-time
patches and others providing several complex modifications.
Regardless, these individuals are generally not involved in the
on-going game development (yet).  They have nonetheless provided some
valued source code contribution to the game and certainly deserve
mention and appreciation for their involvement.
