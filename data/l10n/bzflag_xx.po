# This is a generic l10n file, copy it to a real language po file and modify that one

# Locales are specifed in three parts separated by underscores
# en_US_l33t, for example
# The first part is the base language, the second part is a country code, the third part is a dialect
# The second and third parts are optional, but if you want to specify a dialect, you need to specify the country
# so, <language>_[<country>[_<dialect>]]

# Language codes can be found at
#  http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt
# Country codes can be found at 
#  http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/diverse/doc/ISO_3166.html

# name your resultant file: bzflag_<locale>.po

# When run, pick a locale like bzflag -locale en_US_l33t
# Your locale will be saved in the bzc file, so you can modify it there as well

# locale files are cummulative. That is, if you specify a locale that contains a country and dialect, 
# the base language file is first loaded, and any strings found in the country file replace the base ones, and then
# strings found in the dialect file replace the country one. So if you have two or three language files based
# on one language, you only need to put the changes in the country and dialect one. The two (or three) files are merged
# at runtime.

# If you don't know a translation for a phrase, just comment out the msgid and msgstr for that entry
# Use the pound # character to comment a line out
