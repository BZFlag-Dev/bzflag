/* This is a really really fugly hack to get around winsock sillyness
 * The newer versions of winsock have a socken_t typedef, and there
 * doesn't seem to be any way to tell the versions apart. However,
 * VC++ helps us out here by treating typedef as #define
 * If we've got a socklen_t typedefed, define HAVE_SOCKLEN_T to
 * avoid #define'ing it in common.h */
