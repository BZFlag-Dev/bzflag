.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B bzadmin
is a textbased client for the game BZFlag. It can't be used for
playing, but it can be used to see when players join and leave the
game, to see the chat messages, and to send messages and commands
to the server, as well as see several other vital game messages.
.PP
When you start bzadmin without any command line options other than
callsign and hostname a simple curses\-based user interface will be
started (unless you built bzadmin without curses support). This
interface is divided into three rectangles; the output window
(which covers almost all of the terminal), the target window, and
the input window.
.PP
The output window is where messages from the server will be shown.
.PP
The target window shows the name of the player that
will receive your next message, or 'all' if it will be a public message.
You can change target by using the left and right arrow keys.
.PP
The input window is where you type your messages. It also supports tab
completion of commands and callsigns. You can clear the input window
with the key combination \fBCtrl\-U\fR, and you can generate a \fB/kick\fR
command for the current target with the F5 key (if the current target
is a player). You can also generate a ban command for the current target with
the F6 key, but this only works if you are an admin and the server has sent
you that players IP address (as a response to a \fB/playerlist\fR command).
.PP
The curses user interface also has a simple menu system where you can edit
the server variables (if you are an admin) and see a player list. If you are
an admin you can also see the IP addresses in the player list, if you have
sent a \fB/playerlist\fR command. The menu shows up when you hit the F2 key.
It only covers the upper half of the screen, so you can still see what's
going on in the game. You can navigate through the menu with the up and
down arrow keys, and use the enter key to select submenus and other menu
items. If you hit F2 again the command prompt will regain keyboard focus,
but the menu will still be visible. If you hit F2 a third time the menu will
go away.

.B \-help
Show a simple help text.
.TP
\fB\-hide \fR\fImsgtype\fR[\fI,msgtype\fR]...
Tell bzadmin not to show these message types. The available message types are
chat, join, kill, leave, pause, ping, rabbit, spawn, time, and over. By default
chat, join, kill, leave, pause, and rabbit are shown. You can also change this
while bzadmin is running with the commands \fB/show <msgtype>\fR and
\fB/hide <msgtype>\fR, and from the curses menu.
.TP
\fB\-show \fR\fImsgtype\fR[\fI,msgtype\fR]...
Tell bzadmin to show these message types. See \fB\-hide\fR for a list of
available message types. If a message type is listed both in \fB\-show\fR
and \fB\-hide\fR it will not be shown.
.TP
\fB\-ui \fR{\fIcurses\fR | \fIstdboth\fR | \fIstdin\fR | \fIstdout\fR}
Select the user interface that you want. The curses interface is the default,
and it is described above.
.br
The stdin interface reads user commands from the standard in stream
and sends them to the server. All server output is ignored.
.br
The stdout interface prints all server output to the standard out stream.
All user input is ignored.
.br
The stdboth interface is a combination of stdin and stdout \- it prints
server output to the standard out stream, and reads user commands from
the standard in stream.
.TP
\fIcallsign\fR[\fI:password\fR]\fI@hostname\fR[\fI:port\fR]
Specifies the callsign that you want your client to use, and the
hostname where the BZFlag server is. The port number is optional,
and the default value is 5154.
.TP
\fIcommand\fR
You can specify messages and commands to send to the server on the
command line. BZAdmin will continue running after sending the
specified commands.
