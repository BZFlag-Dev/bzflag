    <title>Sound Files</title>

    <para>You can customize the sounds that BZFlag plays by getting it
    to load your own sound files. You can do this by replacing the
    original sound files themselves; by putting sound files in another
    directory and using the -directory command line option; or by
    copying the original data files to a new location, replacing the
    sound files, and using the -directory option. On UNIX, you can of
    course use links to data files instead of making copies.</para>

    <para>The sound files must have the original name. The files are
    22.05kHz 16 bit WAV files, stereo or mono. The sound files are
    (not including the usual extension .wav):</para>

    <title>Configuration File</title>

    <sect1>

      <para>BZFlag saves state across invokations in a file. On UNIX
      systems, this file is <filename>~/.bzflag</filename> or
      <filename>~/.bzflag.$(HOST)</filename>; the latter is used only
      if HOST is defined. On Windows systems, this file is
      <filename>bzflag.bzc</filename> and it's in your profile
      directory. The format of the file is the same regardless of
      platform.</para>

      <para>This page describes the format of the configuration file
      and the options that BZFlag understands and uses.</para>

      <para>Not all options are available through the GUI or the
      command line. Options only available through the configuration
      file are marked in bold. Options not available through the GUI
      are marked in italics. Some options available through the GUI
      are not available from the command line; these are not
      marked.</para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1>

      <title>Format</title>

      <para>Each line in the file begins with a name (containing no
      whitespace) followed by whitespace, followed by a value. The
      value begins at the first non-whitespace character and includes
      all characters to the end of the line.</para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1>

      <title>Server Options</title>

      <para>There are lots of server options.  Here are some:</para>

      <screen>
callsign
Last callsign (see -callsign).

email
Last email (see -email).

list
Set the server list server url (see -list).

port
Last server port number (see -port).

server
Last server.

team Last
team name (see -team).

interface
Last multicast interface (see -interface).

startcode
Used for start server menu. Use the GUI to modify this.

      <title>Rendering Options</title>

      <screen>
blend
yes/on -- turns blending on or off.

dither
yes/no -- turns dithering on or off.

gamma
Sets the gamma correction value (brightness).

geometry
Set the window geometry; uses standard X geometry format.

lighting
yes/no -- turns lighting on or off.

quality
low/medium/high -- sets the rendering quality level.

resolution
Sets the default screen resolution.

shadows
yes/no -- turns shadows on or off.

smooth
yes/no -- turns point & line antialiasing on or off.

texture
Sets the texturing filter or turns texturing off. Values can be: no,
nearest, linear, nearestmipmapnearest, linearmipmapnearest,
nearestmipmaplinear, and linearmipmaplinear.

view
normal/stereo/three -- see the -view command line option.

zbuffer
yes/no/disable -- turns the zbuffer algorithm on or off. No zbuffer is
allocated when disabled.

eyesep
Sets the distance between the eyes for stereo rendering.

focal
Sets the distance to the focal plane for stereo rendering.

maxlod
Sets the maximum level of detail to render. Walls are meshed when
lighting is on and this limits the number of polygons that will be
generated.

zbuffersplit
yes/no -- uses a hack to clear the zbuffer less often, at expense of
depth resolution.

zoom
1-8 -- renders at a low resolution and zooms pixels by this factor.

redcolor
Three floating point numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive) -- Gives the
red, green, and blue proportions (respectively) of a red team tank's
color. This is mainly intended for colorblind users to adjust team
colors to something they can unambiguously perceive.

greencolor
Like redcolor but for green team tanks.

bluecolor
Like redcolor but for blue team tanks.

purplecolor
Like redcolor but for purple team tanks.

redradar
Three floating point numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive) -- Gives the
red, green, and blue proportions (respectively) of a red team tank's
color on radar. This is mainly intended for colorblind users to adjust
team colors to something they can unambiguously perceive.

greenradar
Like redradar but for green team tanks.

blueradar
Like redradar but for blue team tanks.

purpleradar
Like redradar but for purple team tanks.

enhancedradar
Enables blending of buildings on radar based on height.

      <title>Key Options<title>

      <para>Key values are either a single key's name or two key names
      separated by a slash (e.g. =/+). The mouse buttons are treated
      as keys and named <quote>Left Mouse</quote>, <quote>Middle
      Mouse</quote>, and <quote>Right Mouse</quote>. Special keys are
      named by the label on the US keyboard. For example, F1, Tab,
      Home, etc. The spacebar uses the name
      <quote>Space</quote>. Other keys use their face character; for
      example, A, B, Z, 4, =, }.</para>

      <para>Note that BZFlag uses some keys that don't have options,
      so they cannot be customized. The frames per second toggle is
      such a key. These functions are masked if a customizable key
      uses that key.</para>

...

quickTeamMessage1

quickTeamMessage2
