  <title>Linux</title>

  <para>The Linux install can use either RPM or DEB formats. To
  install, use rpm or apt, repectively. Its possible that the
  following symbolic links may need to be made to get BZFlag to
  install properly over Mesa:</para>

<screen>
$ ln -s libMesaGL.so.3 /usr/lib/libGL.so.1
$ ln -s libMesaGLU.so.3 /usr/lib/libGLU.so.1
</screen>

  <para>Also, rpm may require the --nodeps option for some systems (to
  get around broken dependencies). However, Mesa is absolutely
  required for DRI systems.</para>
