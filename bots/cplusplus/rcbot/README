The RCLinkBot is an emulator designed to be backwards
compatible with the original BZRC project by Brigham
Young University

In it's current state it is incomplete, however, the
files necessary to finish it up can be found in this
directory.

The general idea is to recreate the only the backend
portion of BZRC on top of an AdvancedRobot, then run
standalone server to which a single agent can connect.
