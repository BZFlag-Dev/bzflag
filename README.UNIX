README for Unix platforms
-------------------------

Unix is the native OS of bzflag so the build works best on Unix
and Linux.  The instructions in README are correct for building
on Unix.

  % make <platform>
  % make

or, if you want to build an installable package:

  % make <platform>
  % make package

If you're building Mesa 3 on Linux PPC, there's one file that
causes an internal compiler error at the optimization levels
O2 and above (the default is O5) on some versions of Mesa and
the compiler.  Just build that file at optimization level O1.
