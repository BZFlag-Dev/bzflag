// Some notes:
//
// - Any packets that get broadcast are buffered. Look for the
//   Record::addPacket() hook in the buffered message manager. For now,
//   it will not be mainting any information with regards to the
//   state of the game during replay. It'll just be firing the
//   packets back out the way that they came.
//
// - We have to watch for collisions between the PlayerID's that
//   are being sent by the replay, and the PlayerIDs of those
//   watching. For now, I'm just going to force replay watching
//   observer ids to be above 200. We could also do a PlayerID
//   mapping, but then you'd have to dig into every packet that
//   uses a PlayerID (ick).
//
// - To avoid having to track game state, we're simply going to
//   take snapshots of the player and flag states periodically.
//   These state packets will only be saved if there have been
//   broadcasted packets, so that idle servers won't necessarily
//   have massive files if they're saving straight to a file.
//
// - Ideally, it would be nice to be able to set replay mode for
//   individual players. Then, admins would be able to review events
//   that happened 30 seconds ago without having to disconnect from
//   the server.
