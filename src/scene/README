Notes on the Octree  (trepan)
-----------------------------
1. It will be converted to use a flat memory space (less cache thrash)
2. The occluders will be also be used for scene node culling
3. The occluder selection algorithm will be improved. The easier (and
   possibly best way), to do this is to use the GL_ARB_occlusion_query
   or GL_NV_occlusion_query extensions. If those aren't avaible, plane
   area, distance from the eye, and angle towards the eye can all be useful.
4. The occluders will be more useful if they are merged into larger convex
   polygons before using them. Otherwise, the seems between adjacent
   occluders cause culling leaks.
5. The testTriPlaneInAxisBox() function is junk. It'll be fixed using a
   separation axis type test (pretty quick).
6. Some of the scene node culling might be better done with axis aligned
   bounding boxes.
7. All static scene nodes will be tested for culling before being send out
   of the ZSceneDatabase.
8. Sort the scene nodes by area before inserting into the octree
9. Frustum culling could be done using a proximal decent, 1-3-3-1 cube
