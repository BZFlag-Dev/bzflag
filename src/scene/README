Notes on the Octree  (trepan)
-----------------------------
1.  It will be converted to use a flat memory space (less cache thrash)
2.  The occluders will be also be used for scene node culling
3.  The occluder selection algorithm will be improved. The easier (and
    possibly best way), to do this is to use the GL_ARB_occlusion_query
    or GL_NV_occlusion_query extensions. If those aren't available, plane
    area, distance from the eye, and angle towards the eye can all be useful.
4.  The occluders can be improved by merging them into larger convex
    polygons before using them. Otherwise, the seams between adjacent
    occluders cause culling leaks.
5.  The testTriPlaneInAxisBox() function is junk. It'll be fixed using a
    separation axis type test.
6.  Some of the scene node culling might be better done with axis aligned
    bounding boxes.
7.  All static scene nodes will be tested for culling before being send out
    of the ZSceneDatabase.
8.  Sort the scene nodes by area before inserting into the octree
9.  Frustum culling could be done using a proximal descent, 1-3-3-1 cube.
10. If a cell is fully frustum visible, but partially occluded, then still
    still check for occlusions on sub-cell.
11. Maintain a list of useful occluders at each depth
12. Have cells keep a record of the last culler that killed them
    (either the frustum or one of the occluders)
13. Parent octree cells should swallow 'only-child' cells
14. Add a limit to the total number of octree nodes? (so that silly map
    makers don't have their computer eaten alive by the bzflag client)
15. Shadow nodes are getting clipped because of the odd projection
    matrix that they use to cast themselves up on the ground. This could
    be fixed by adding all of the shadow nodes before the Octree culls
    their sources (the same is done now in SceneNode::getRenderNodes())
