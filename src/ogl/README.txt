The facilities in this directory wrap rendering state, and texture maps.
There are a number of places outside this library where OpenGL is used,
and those places need to be migrated over into this library.  Ideally
all rendering library calls will go through this interface.  As OpenGL
has the widest support of any rendering library, this is pretty much a
non-issue (unless someone wants to port to a game console).
