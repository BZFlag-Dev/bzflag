/**
 *
 * @brief
 * convert doubles to and from host/network format
 *
 * Library routines for conversion between the local host 64-bit
 * ("double precision") representation, and 64-bit IEEE double
 * precision representation, in "network order", ie, big-endian, the
 * MSB in byte [0], on the left.
 *
 * As a quick review, the IEEE double precision format is as follows:
 * sign bit, 11 bits of exponent (bias 1023), and 52 bits of mantissa,
 * with a hidden leading one (0.1 binary).
 *
 * When the exponent is 0, IEEE defines a "denormalized number", which
 * is not supported here.
 *
 * When the exponent is 2047 (all bits set), and:
 *	all mantissa bits are zero,
 *	value is infinity*sign,
 *	mantissa is non-zero, and:
 *		msb of mantissa=0:  signaling NAN
 *		msb of mantissa=1:  quiet NAN
 *
 * Note that neither the input or output buffers need be word aligned,
 * for greatest flexability in converting data, even though this
 * imposes a speed penalty here.
 *
 * These subroutines operate on a sequential block of numbers, to save
 * on subroutine linkage execution costs, and to allow some hope for
 * vectorization.
 *
 * These routines originated and were derived from BRL-CAD sources.
