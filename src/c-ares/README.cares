c-ares
======

This package is based on ares 1.1.1 (written by Greg Hudson). I decided to
fork and release a separate project since the ares author didn't want the
improvements that were vital for our use of it.

This package is dubbed 'c-ares' since I (Daniel Stenberg) wanted this for use
within the curl project (hence the letter C) and it makes a nice pun. Also,
c-ares is not API compatible with ares: a new name makes that more obvious to
the public.

The full source code is available in the 'c-ares' release archives, and in the
'ares' subdir of the curl CVS source repostitory.

If you find bugs, correct flaws, have questions or have comments in general in
regard to c-ares (or by all means the original ares too), get in touch with us
on the c-ares mailing list: http://cool.haxx.se/mailman/listinfo/c-ares

c-ares is of course distributed under the same MIT-style license as the
original ares.
