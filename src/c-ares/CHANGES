  Changelog for the c-ares project

Version 1.2.1 (October 20, 2004)

* September 29

- Henrik Stoerner fix: got a report that Tru64 Unix (the unix from Digital
  when they made Alpha's) uses /etc/svc.conf for the purpose fixed below for
  other OSes. He made c-ares check for and understand it if present.

- Now c-ares will use local host name lookup _before_ DNS resolving by default
  if nothing else is told.

* September 26

- Henrik Stoerner: found out that c-ares does not look at the /etc/host.conf
  file to determine the sequence in which to search /etc/hosts and DNS.  So on
  systems where this order is defined by /etc/host.conf instead of a "lookup"
  entry in /etc/resolv.conf, c-ares will always default to looking in DNS
  first, and /etc/hosts second.

  c-ares now looks at

  1) resolv.conf (for the "lookup" line);
  2) nsswitch.fon (for the "hosts:" line);
  3) host.conf (for the "order" line).

  First match wins.

- Dominick Meglio patched: C-ares on Windows assumed that the HOSTS file is
  located in a static location. It assumed
  C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\Etc. This is a poor assumption to make. In fact,
  the location of the HOSTS file can be changed via a registry setting.

  There is a key called DatabasePath which specifies the path to the HOSTS
  file:
  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/network/deploy/depovg/tcpip2k.mspx

  The patch will make c-ares correctly consult the registry for the location
  of this file.

* August 29

- Gisle Vanem fixed the MSVC build files.

* August 20

- Gisle Vanem made c-ares build and work with his Watt-32 TCP/IP stack.

* August 13

- Harshal Pradhan made a minor syntax change in ares_init.c to make it build
  fine with MSVC 7.1

* July 24

- Made the lib get built static only if --enable-debug is used.

- Gisle Vanem fixed:

  Basically in loops like handle_errors(), 'query->next' was assigned a local
  variable and then query was referenced after the memory was freed by
  next_server(). I've changed that so next_server() and end_query() returns
  the next query. So callers should use this ret-value.

  The next problem was that 'server->tcp_buffer_pos' had a random value at
  entry to 1st recv() (luckily causing Winsock to return ENOBUFS).

  I've also added a ares_writev() for Windows to streamline the code a bit
  more.

* July 20
- Fixed a few variable return types for some system calls. Made configure
  check for ssize_t to make it possible to use that when receiving the send()
  error code. This is necessary to prevent compiler warnings on some systems.

- Made configure create config.h, and all source files now include setup.h that
  might include the proper config.h (or a handicrafted alternative).

- Switched to 'ares_socket_t' type for sockets in ares, since Windows don't
  use 'int' for that.

- automake-ified and libool-ified c-ares. Now it builds libcares as a shared
  lib on most platforms if wanted. (This bloated the size of the release
  archive with another 200K!)

- Makefile.am now uses Makefile.inc for the c sources, h headers and man
  pages, to make it easier for other makefiles to use the exact same set of
  files.

- Adjusted 'maketgz' to use the new automake magic when building distribution
  archives.

- Anyone desires HTML and/or PDF versions of the man pages in the release
  archives?

* July 3
- Günter Knauf made c-ares build and run on Novell Netware.

* July 1
- Gisle Vanem provided Makefile.dj to build with djgpp, added a few more djgpp
  fixes and made ares not use 'errno' to provide further info on Windows.

* June 30
- Gisle Vanem made it build with djgpp and run fine with the Watt-32 stack.

* June 10
- Gisle Vanem's init patch for Windows:

  The init_by_resolv_conf() function fetches the DNS-server(s)
  from a series of registry branches.

  This can be wrong in the case where DHCP has assigned nameservers, but the
  user has overridden these servers with other prefered settings. Then it's
  wrong to use the DHCPNAMESERVER setting in registry.

  In the case of no global DHCP-assigned or fixed servers, but DNS server(s)
  per adapter, one has to query the adapter branches.  But how can c-ares know
  which adapter is valid for use? AFAICS it can't. There could be one adapter
  that is down (e.g. a VPN adapter).

  So it's better to leave this to the IP Helper API (iphlapi) available in
  Win-98/2000 and later. My patch falls-back to the old way if not available.

* June 8
- James Bursa fixed an init issue for RISC OS.

* May 11
- Nico Stappenbelt reported that when processing domain and search lines in
  the resolv.conf file, the first entry encountered is processed and used as
  the search list. According to the manual pages for both Linux, Solaris and
  Tru64, the last entry of either a domain or a search field is used.

  This is now adjusted in the code

Version 1.2.0 (April 13, 2004)

* April 2, 2004
- Updated various man pages to look nicer when converted to HTML on the web
  site.

* April 1, 2004
- Dirk Manske provided a new function that is now named ares_cancel(). It is
  used to cancel/cleanup a resolve/request made using ares functions on the
  given ares channel. It does not destroy/kill the ares channel itself.

- Dominick Meglio cleaned up the formatting in several man pages.

* March 30, 2004
- Dominick Meglio's new ares_expand_string. A helper function when decoding
  incoming DNS packages.

- Daniel Stenberg modified the Makefile.in to use a for loop for the man page
  installation to improve overview and make it easier to add man pages.

Version 1.1.0 (March 11, 2004)

* March 9, 2004
- Gisle Vanem improved build on Windows.

* February 25, 2004
- Dan Fandrich found a flaw in the Feb 22 fix.

- Added better configure --enable-debug logic (taken from the curl configure
  script). Added acinclude.m4 to the tarball.

* February 23, 2004
- Removed ares_free_errmem(), the function, the file and the man page. It was
  not used and it did nothing.

- Fixed a lot of code that wasn't "64bit clean" and thus caused a lot of
  compiler warnings on picky compilers.

* February 22, 2004
- Dominick Meglio made ares init support multiple name servers in the
  NameServer key on Windows.

* February 16, 2004
- Modified ares_private.h to include libcurl's memory debug header if
  CURLDEBUG is set. This makes all the ares-functions supervised properly by
  the curl test suite. This also forced me to add inclusion of the
  ares_private.h header in a few more files that are using some kind of
  memory-related resources.

- Made the makefile only build ahost and adig if 'make demos' is used.

* February 10, 2004
- Dirk Manske made ares_version.h installed with 'make install'

* February 4, 2004
- ares_free_errmem() is subject for removal, it is simply present for future
  purposes, and since we removed the extra parameter in strerror() it won't
  be used by c-ares!
- configure --enable-debug now enables picky compiler options if gcc is used
- fixed several compiler warnings --enable-debug showed and Joerg Mueller-Tolk
  reported

Version 1.0.0 (February 3, 2004)

* February 3, 2004
- now we produce the libcares.a library instead of the previous libares.a
  since we are no longer compatible

* February 2, 2004

- ares_strerror() has one argument less. This is the first official
  modification of the existing provided ares API.

* January 29, 2004

- Dirk Manske fixed how the socket is set non-blocking.

* January 4, 2004

- Dominick Meglio made the private gettimeofday() become ares_gettimeofday()
  instead in order to not pollute the name space and risk colliding with
  other libraries' versions of this function.

* October 24, 2003. Daniel Stenberg

  Added ares_version().

Version 1.0-pre1 (8 October 2003)

- James Bursa made it run on RISC OS

- Dominick Meglio made it run fine on NT4

- Duncan Wilcox made it work fine on Mac OS X

- Daniel Stenberg adjusted the windows port

- liren at vivisimo.com made the initial windows port

* Imported the sources from ares 1.1.1
