Included here should be the core non-generic logic of bzflag.  The
aspects of the game that are potentially useful to other applications
(server, client, or otherwise) should be put here instead of into the
application front-ends.  The game lib is a middle layer sitting
between the generic common functionality that is completely
application-agnostic and the logic and appearance completely specific
to a single particular application.

If your code is not bz-specific or could not potentially be used in
another application, it probably doesn't belong in here.  If your code
cannot really be used in another application without modification,
perhaps specific to rendering or display of data, it probably doesn't
belong in here.
