Included here should be the core logic of bzflag.  The aspects of the
game that are potentially useful to other clients should be put here
instead of into the application front-end.  The game lib is a middle
layer sitting between the generic common functionality that is
application-agnostic and the logic and appearance specific to a single
particular application.

If your code is not bzflag-specific, or could potentially be used in
another application, it probably doesn't belong in here.  If your code
cannot really be used in another client without modification, perhaps
specific to rendering or presentation, it probably doesn't belong in
here.
