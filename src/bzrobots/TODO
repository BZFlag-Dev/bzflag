? Convert RCLink to use an STL type and not a static buffer (overflows, though handled "gracefully", shouldn't be happening).
? Make RCLink more c++-ish, by e.g. using operator << and not sendf/vsendf/send.
! Implement all events as per RoboCode standards.
! SWIGify BZAdvancedRobot etc.
! Implement a script-loader.
! Implement proper RoboCode compatability (radar, turret-turning, more?)
