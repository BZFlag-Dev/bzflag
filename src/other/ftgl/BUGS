BUGS
====

* FTGLTextureFonts can't be used inside display lists. This because
  the glGet call to check the current texture id can't be used in a
  display list. It is only a valid call when the list is compiled and
  is ignore after that.

* The texture co-ords in the Texture Font may be wrong for non
  scalable fonts.

* /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-larabie-deco/let_seat.ttf has issues
  with the outset position (glyph "u").
  /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-larabie-straight/teenlite.ttf has the
  same problem but it depends the glyph size.

* /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-larabie-straight/primer.ttf has filling
  issues.

* The content of textured quads are properly antialiased but their edges
  remain blocky because there is no possible interpolation. Maybe adding
  a 1-pixel border would help.
