BUGS
====

* FTExtrdGlyph - Some glyph contours are 'wound' in reverse causing
  the 'sides' of the extrusions to be culled. First fix only half
  worked. When calculating the winding using the summed area I need to
  use the outside contour only. How do I know it's an outside contour?
  A workaround is to disable face culling.

* FTGLTextureFonts can't be used inside display lists. This because
  the glGet call to check the current texture id can't be used in a
  display list. It is only a valid call when the list is compiled and
  is ignore after that.

* The texture co-ords in the Texture Font may be wrong for non
  scalable fonts.
