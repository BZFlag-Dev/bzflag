FTGL Version 2.0

This project will build a static library (archive) in this directory.

FTGL requires the Freetype2 library (version 2.0.9 or later) and OpenGL (glu
version 1.2 or later). You may need to edit the paths to point to the correct
place.

To use FTGL in your own projects you will need to link against this lib. Your
project will also need to point to Freetype and OpenGL.

For instructions on using Freetype go to www.freetype.org
For instructions on using OpenGL go to www.opengl.org

Please contact me if you have any suggestions, feature requests, or problems.
