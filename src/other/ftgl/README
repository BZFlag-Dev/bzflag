FTGL 2.1
5 December 2004

DESCRIPTION:

FTGL is a free open source library to enable developers to use arbitrary
fonts in their OpenGL (www.opengl.org)  applications.
Unlike other OpenGL font libraries FTGL uses standard font file formats
so doesn't need a preprocessing step to convert the high quality font data
into a lesser quality, proprietary format.
FTGL uses the Freetype (www.freetype.org) font library to open and 'decode'
the fonts. It then takes that output and stores it in a format most efficient
for OpenGL rendering.

Rendering modes supported are
- Bit maps
- Antialiased Pix maps
- Texture maps
- Outlines
- Polygon meshes
- Extruded polygon meshes

FTGL is designed to be used in commercial quality software. It has been
written with performance, robustness and simplicity in mind.

USAGE:

	FTGLPixmapFont font( "Fonts:Arial");

	font.FaceSize( 72);
	
	font.render( "Hello World!");
