This release includes the following changes:
 
 o added support for HttpOnly cookies
 o 'make ca-bundle' downloads and generates an updated ca bundle file
 o we no longer distribute or install a ca cert bundle
 o SSLv2 is now disabled by default for SSL operations
 o the test509-style setting URL in callback is officially no longer supported
 o support a full chain of certificates in a given PKCS12 certificate
 o resumed transfers work with SFTP
 o added type checking macros for curl_easy_setopt() and curl_easy_getinfo(),
   watch out for new warnings in code using libcurl (needs gcc-4.3 and
   currently only works in C mode)
 o curl_easy_setopt(), curl_easy_getinfo(), curl_share_setopt() and
   curl_multi_setopt() uses are now checked to use exactly three arguments
 o --with-ca-path=DIR configure option allows to set an openSSL CApath instead
   of a default ca bundle.

This release includes the following bugfixes:

 o improved pipelining
 o improved strdup replacement
 o GnuTLS-built libcurl failed when doing global cleanup and reinit
 o error message problem when unable to resolve a host on Windows
 o Accept: header replacing
 o not verifying server certs with GnuTLS still failed if gnutls had
   problems with the cert
 o when using the multi interface and a handle is removed while still having
   a transfer going on, the connection is now closed by force
 o bad re-use of SSL connections in non-complete state
 o test case 405 failures with GnuTLS builds
 o crash when connection cache size is 1 and Curl_do() failed
 o GnuTLS-built libcurl can now be forced to prefer SSLv3
 o crash when doing Negotiate again on a re-used connection
 o select/poll regression
 o better MIT kerberos configure check
 o curl_easy_reset() + SFTP re-used connection download crash
 o SFTP non-existing file + SFTP existing file error
 o sharing DNS cache between easy handles running in multiple threads could
   lead to crash
 o SFTP upload with CURLOPT_FTP_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS on re-used connection
 o SFTP infinite loop when given an invalid quote command
 o curl-config erroneously reported LDAPS support with missing LDAP libraries
 o SCP infinite loop when downloading a zero byte file
 o setting the CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION with libcurl built without OpenSSL
   now makes curl_easy_setopt() properly return failure
 o configure --with-libssh2 (with no given path)
