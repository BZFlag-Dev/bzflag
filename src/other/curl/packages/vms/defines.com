$! Define where to look for the curl include directory, where to put the 
$! exes and objects, and the openssl stuff.  If you have hp's SSL product 
$! installed you won't need these openssl, libssl and libcrypto defines.
$!
$! Be cautioned, though.  If you build using these defines at the process
$! level and then try to build against hp's SSL product, you will need to 
$! deassign the openssl logical at the process level or the link will most
$! probably fail, or define CURL_BUILD_NOHPSSL to anything.
$!
$!  8-FEB-2005, MSK, changed the openssl, libssl and libcrypto defines
$!                   to not override previously defined logicals.
