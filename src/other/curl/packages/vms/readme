History:

 9-MAR-2004, Created this readme. file.  Marty Kuhrt (MSK).
15-MAR-2004, MSK, Updated to reflect the new files in this directory.
14-FEB-2005, MSK, removed config-vms.h_with* file comments


Prerequisites:

OpenVMS V7.0 or later (any platform)
DECC V6.5 or later
OpenSSL or hp SSL, if you want SSL support

What is Here:

This directory contains the following files:

AXP.DIR                  - Target directory for Alpha builds.
BATCH_COMPILE.COM        - Quick and dirty batch build procedure.
BUILD_VMS.COM            - The brute force build procedure that sets
                           up the config files, and builds all the C 
                           and MSG files in the lib and src
                           subdirectories.
CONFIG-VMS.H             - The config file used for all builds.
CURLMSG.H                - Created with SDL/ALPHA/LANGUAGE=CC CURLMSG.SDL
                           (Needs freeware SDL tool)
CURLMSG.MSG              - Source for .SDL and .H as well as the 
                           .OBJ used to link against for error messages.
CURLMSG.SDL              - Created with MESSAGE/SDL CURLMSG.MSG.
CURLMSG_VMS.H            - Maps curl error codes to VMS error numbers.
DEFINES.COM              - Some handy logicals needed for the build.
                           You may need to update this for your setup.
HPSSL_ALPHA.OPT          - Option file for hp SSL link on Alpha.
HPSSL_IA64.OPT           - Option file for hp SSL link on IA64.
HPSSL_VAX.OPT            - Option file for hp SSL link on VAX.
IA64.DIR                 - Target directory for IA64 builds.
README.                  - This file.
VAX.DIR                  - Target directory for VAX builds.


How to Build:

In theory you should be able to do an @defines followed by an
@build_vms from this directory and it will create brand new .olbs and
an .exe.  I say in theory because every release of cURL tosses in a
new twist that has to be addressed by updating the config-vms.h*
files, or other files.  I'm working on keeping all the OpenVMS
dependant stuff in this config file to keep from having to wade
through gobs of #ifdefs and such.

Other Notes:

The test suites are not supported as of 7.11.0.

The CURLMSG.SDL and CURLMSG.H files are generated from CURLMSG.MSG.
This is not done automatically, since the .MSG file is a hand edit
of the relevant stuff from the CURL.H file.  If you want to do this
yourself you'll need the SDL package from the freeware CD.
