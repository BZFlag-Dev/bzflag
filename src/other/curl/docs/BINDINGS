                               libcurl bindings

Creative people have written bindings or interfaces for various environments
and programming languages. Using one of these allows you to take advantage of
curl powers from within your favourite language or system.

This is a list of all known interfaces as of this writing.

The bindings listed below are not part of the curl/libcurl distribution
archives, but must be downloaded and installed separately.
