.SH NAME
curl_multi_setopt \- set options for a curl multi handle
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM * multi_handle, CURLMoption option, param);
.SH DESCRIPTION
curl_multi_setopt() is used to tell a libcurl multi handle how to behave. By
using the appropriate options to \fIcurl_multi_setopt(3)\fP, you can change
libcurl's behaviour when using that multi handle.  All options are set with
the \fIoption\fP followed by the parameter \fIparam\fP. That parameter can be
a \fBlong\fP, a \fBfunction pointer\fP, an \fBobject pointer\fP or a
\fBcurl_off_t\fP type, depending on what the specific option expects. Read
this manual carefully as bad input values may cause libcurl to behave badly!
You can only set one option in each function call.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION
Pass a pointer to a function matching the \fBcurl_socket_callback\fP
prototype. The \fIcurl_multi_socket(3)\fP functions inform the application
about updates in the socket (file descriptor) status by doing none, one or
multiple calls to the curl_socket_callback given in the \fBparam\fP
argument. They update the status with changes since the previous time a
\fIcurl_multi_socket(3)\fP function was called. If the given callback pointer
is NULL, no callback will be called. Set the callback's \fBuserp\fP argument
with \fICURLMOPT_SOCKETDATA\fP.  See \fIcurl_multi_socket(3)\fP for more
callback details.
.IP CURLMOPT_SOCKETDATA
Pass a pointer to whatever you want passed to the \fBcurl_socket_callback\fP's
forth argument, the userp pointer. This is not used by libcurl but only
passed-thru as-is. Set the callback pointer with
\fICURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION\fP.
.IP CURLMOPT_PIPELINING
Pass a long set to 1 to enable or 0 to disable. Enabling pipelining on a multi
handle will make it attempt to perform HTTP Pipelining as far as possible for
transfers using this handle. This means that if you add a second request that
can use an already existing connection, the second request will be \&"piped"
on the same connection rather than being executed in parallell. (Added in
7.16.0)
.IP CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION
Pass a pointer to a function matching the \fBcurl_multi_timer_callback\fP
prototype.  This function will then be called when the timeout value
changes. The timeout value is at what latest time the application should call
one of the \&"performing" functions of the multi interface
(\fIcurl_multi_socket(3)\fP, \fIcurl_multi_socket_all(3)\fP and
\fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP) - to allow libcurl to keep timeouts and retries
etc to work. Libcurl attempts to limit calling this only when the fixed future
timeout time actually change. See also \fICURLMOPT_TIMERDATA\fP. This callback
can be used instead of, or in addition to, \fIcurl_multi_timeout(3)\fP. (Added
in 7.16.0)
.IP CURLMOPT_TIMERDATA
Pass a pointer to whatever you want passed to the
\fBcurl_multi_timer_callback\fP's third argument, the userp pointer.  This is
not used by libcurl but only passed-thru as-is. Set the callback pointer with
\fICURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION\fP. (Added in 7.16.0)
.SH RETURNS
The standard CURLMcode for multi interface error codes. Note that it returns a
CURLM_UNKNOWN_OPTION if you try setting an option that this version of libcurl
doesn't know of.
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function was added in libcurl 7.15.4.
