.SH NAME
curl_easy_cleanup - End a libcurl easy session
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>

.BI "void curl_easy_cleanup(CURL *" handle ");"

.SH DESCRIPTION
This function must be the last function to call for an easy session. It is the
opposite of the \fIcurl_easy_init(3)\fP function and must be called with the
same \fIhandle\fP as input that the curl_easy_init call returned.

This will effectively close all connections this handle has used and possibly
has kept open until now. Don't call this function if you intend to transfer
more files.

When you've called this, you can safely remove all the strings you've
previously told libcurl to use, as it won't use them anymore now.

Any uses of the \fBhandle\fP after this function has been called are
illegal. This kills the handle and all memory associated with it!
.SH RETURN VALUE
None
.SH "SEE ALSO"
