/* FinderLaunch converts a list of nTargets FSSpec records pointed to by the
	targetList parameter and converts the list to an apple event.  It then
	sends that event to the Finder.  The array of FSSpec records pointed
	to by the targetList parameter may contain references to files, folders,
	or applications.  The net effect of this command is equivalent to the
	user selecting an icon in one of the Finder's windows and then choosing
	the open command from the Finder's file menu. */
