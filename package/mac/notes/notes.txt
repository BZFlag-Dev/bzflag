Using GUSI 2.0...

1. Trying to compile network code.
	Have to remove conflicting MSL headers for now...
	Had to remove signal.h and csignal
	Added my own strcasecmp
	Found missing errno.... EBADMSG
	Dang MSL... added to prefix #define __NO_WIDE_CHAR
	Compiled bzfs!!!

2. Added to prefix #define ROBOTS - had to for undefined vars

3. GUSISignal.cp 413 put in debugger break when exit is called
