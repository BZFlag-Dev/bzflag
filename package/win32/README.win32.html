This is the README file for the Windows 95/98/NT version of BZFlag.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://BZFlag.SourceForge.net/">BZFlag</A> is a network
multiplayer 3D tank battle game.  You can play against several
other people anywhere on a TCP/IP based network, including the
Internet.  BZFlag is freeware;  please read the LICENSE file
found where you installed BZFlag.
</P>

<P>
BZFlag should run well on a Windows 95/98/NT system with 16MB RAM,
though 24MB is recommended.  Any graphics card will work but a
3D graphics card with OpenGL acceleration is highly recommended.
A sound card with DirectSound support is optional.  A network
card or a modem with PPP software is required.
</P>
<P>
BZFlag requires, but does not come with, three free "libraries."
<UL>
    <LI><A HREF="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles/opengl95.exe">OpenGL</A>
	-- a vendor neutral, platform independent 3D graphics library
    <LI><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/default.asp">DirectX</A>
	-- Microsoft's multimedia libraries
    <LI><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wuadmintools/s_wunetworkingtools/w95sockets2/?RLD=114">Winsock 2</A>
	-- a TCP/IP network library
</UL>
The easiest way to find out if you have the necessary libraries installed
is to run <B>bzflag.exe</B>.  Look for these errors:
<UL>
    <LI>OPENGL32.DLL not found -- install OpenGL
    <LI>DSOUND.DLL not found -- install DirectX
    <LI>WS2_32.DLL not found -- install Winsock 2
</UL>

<P>
Run Add/Remove Programs (from the control panels), select BZFlag, and
press Add/Remove....

<P>
To begin playing BZFlag, double-click the bzflag.exe icon.
BZFlag may ask you to choose a screen resolution and color
depth.  Once you've selected one that BZFlag could successfully
switch to (sometimes it has trouble switching), the game will
go fullscreen, load its data files, and show the main menu.
<P>
</P>
Use the arrow, enter, and escape keys to navigate the menus.
You should first browse the `Help' menu.  Use Page Up and Page
Down to cycle through the help pages.  These pages explain the
game, how to play, and which keys are bound to which controls.
You can change the key bindings from the `Change Key Mapping'
menu under `Options' menu.
<P>
</P>
To play you must join a game using the `Join Game' menu.  You
have the option of starting a server on your own machine using
`Start Server.'  Once started you'll still need to choose which
server to connect to.
<P>
</P>
Use `Find Server' to search for an existing server.  Select a
server from the list and press enter (press escape to cancel).
This sets the server name in the `Join Game' menu.  You can
enter a name manually if `Find Server' doesn't show the server
you want.  You may need to set the port too.  The default port
number is 5155 and most servers will use this.
<P>
</P>
If you haven't entered a callsign before, you need to type one
before connecting to a server.  This is the name you'll be known
by during the game.  You should also choose a team before
joining the server.  Note that some servers will reject Rogues;
you'll need to choose a team color to join those servers.  You
cannot change teams once you've joined a game, though you can
reconnect later with a different team and/or callsign.
<P>
</P>
Once you have your callsign, team, server, and port setup, use
`Connect' to join the game.  If anything goes wrong, the game
will show an error message telling you how to correct the
problem.  Otherwise, you'll find yourself ready to play in the
center of the game board.
<P>
</P>
Your name and score are shown in your team color in the upper
left.  The scoreboard lists all the players (you're always
listed first), their scores, and the number of times you've
killed and been killed by that player.  Your current status is
at the top center.  Press the right mouse button to start
playing!

<H3>T<FONT SIZE="2">ROUBLE</FONT></H3>
<P>
Typical problems with BZFlag involve either the graphics or the
network.
</P>
<P>
<B>Graphics</B>:  BZFlag uses OpenGL for rendering.  If you don't have
a graphics card that accelerates OpenGL you'll never get a good
frame rate.  Some cards support OpenGL better than others so you
may want to fiddle with the graphics options in the `Options'
menu if your frame rate is low or the graphics look wrong.  The
`t' and `y' keys toggle frame rate and time-per-frame readouts.
</P>
<P>
If the game runs but the rendering is wrong, your OpenGL driver
is broken.  It is <U>not</U> a problem with BZFlag.  Try getting the
latest OpenGL drivers from your card manufacturer (or even the
latest reference drivers from the chipset manufacturer).  Also,
the freeware Mesa library accelerates OpenGL on 3Dfx cards.
</P>
<P>
One exception to this is if the rendering is too dark.  This is
because BZFlag assumes a linear brightness mapping but this isn't
true unless you've set the appropriate gamma correction for your
display.  If your graphics card supports `gamma correction' on
the display control panel, then modify the gamma to a level that
makes BZFlag look better.  Gamma correction should be a standard
part of the operating system, but as of Windows 98 and NT 4.0
Microsoft has neglected to do this.  If your card doesn't support
gamma correction, you'll simply have to adjust the options to get
the brightest results you can.  Try adjusting the time of day and
turning off lighting.
</P>
<P>
BZFlag prints the renderer name when it starts up in the message
window.  If it says `Generic' then you're using software only.
You either haven't installed the OpenGL ICD correctly.  Quit the
game, fix the problem and run BZFlag again.
</P>
<P>
<B>Network</B>:  Network problems can be more difficult to track down.
If BZFlag complains that it Winsock isn't available or is the
wrong version, download Winsock 2 from the Microsoft website and
install it.  Watch out for beta versions of Winsock.  One beta
version has a bug that causes BZFlag to run at no more than one
frame per second.
</P>
<P>
If you can start BZFlag but can't seem to join any servers, try
starting one on your own system.  If this fails, it's probably
because bzfs.exe wasn't found.  You should put bzflag.exe and
bzfs.exe in the same directory and run BZFlag from that directory.
This is how the installer sets things up.  Quit BZFlag, fix the
problem, and restart.
</P>
<P>
If you're sure bzfs.exe is being found, check that you've got
TCP/IP networking setup.  If you can access the network using a
web browser then TCP/IP should be setup correctly.  If not, try
getting the browser working then try BZFlag again.
</P>
<P>
If you can connect to a server on your own host but not other
hosts then your TCP/IP networking probably isn't setup properly or
your network cable isn't hooked into the network.  Again, try to
get a web browser working across your network then try BZFlag again.
</P>
<P>
If you can't find servers on your network, there either aren't any
servers or your network doesn't support multicating.  Either `Start
Server' or enter the server host name manually on the `Join Game'
menu then Connect.
</P>
<P>
If you can join the server but you can't see other players or other
players never move and you can't shoot them then the game has
decided that multicasting is available, but it was wrong.  Modify
the shortcut to bzflag.exe (or otherwise run bzflag.exe) with the
command line option `-ttl 0'.
</P>
<P>
If you're using BZFlag over a modem, you'll need to run PPP before
starting BZFlag.  BZFlag only uses TCP/IP networking;  PPP makes
TCP/IP work over your modem.
