<h1>BZFlag Readme</h1>
<hr>
<p>
This is the README file for the Windows version of BZFlag.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://BZFlag.org/">BZFlag</a> is a network
multiplayer 3D tank battle game. You can play against several other
people anywhere on the Internet. BZFlag is freeware and Open Source;
please read the file COPYING found where you installed BZFlag.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
BZFlag will run on Windows XP/Vista/7 systems, with limited support for Windows
2000. A hardware accelerated graphics card with current drivers is highly
recommended for adequate performance. The game requires 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=2da43d38-db71-4c1b-bc6a-9b6652cd92a3&amp;displaylang=en">
DirectX 8 or greater</a> to be installed.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Global Registration</h3>
<p>Many game servers require users to be globally registered to play.
Global registration is free and handled by the official BZFlag forums.
Please go to <a href="http://my.bzflag.org/bb/">http://my.bzflag.org/bb/</a>
to create a global account. A valid e-mail address is required.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Uninstalling</h3>
<p>
Navigate to the Start Menu and locate the BZFlag directory. Click on the
Uninstall item and follow the onscreen directions. Note that your configuration
will not be deleted. This is stored in your documents folder under "My BZFlag
Files".
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Playing</h3>
<p>
To begin playing BZFlag, launch the game using the start menu
or quicklaunch shortcuts.  The game will go fullscreen (unless you
are starting in windowed mode), load its data files, and show the
main menu.
</p>
<p>
Use the arrow, enter, and escape keys to navigate the menus.
You should first browse the `Help' menu.  Use Page Up and Page
Down to cycle through the help pages.  These pages explain the
game, how to play, and which keys are bound to which controls.
You can change the key bindings from the `Change Key Mapping'
menu under `Options' menu.
</p>
<p>
To play you must join a game using the `Join Game' menu.  You
have the option of starting a server on your own machine using
`Start Server.'  Once started you'll still need to choose which
server to connect to.
</p>
<p>
Use `Find Server' to search for an existing server.  Select a
server from the list and press enter (press escape to cancel).
This sets the server name and port number in the `Join Game'
menu.  You can enter a name manually if `Find Server' doesn't
show the server you want.  You may need to set the port too.
The default port number is 5154 and most servers will use this.
</p>
<p>
If you haven't entered a callsign before, you need to type one
before connecting to a server.  This is the name you'll be known
by during the game.  You should also choose a team before
joining the server.  Note that some servers will reject Rogues;
you'll need to choose a team color to join those servers.  You
cannot change teams once you've joined a game, though you can
reconnect later with a different team and/or callsign.
</p>
<p>
Once you have your callsign, team, server, and port set up, use
`Connect' to join the game.  If anything goes wrong, the game
will show an error message telling you how to correct the
problem.  Otherwise, you'll find yourself ready to play.
</p>
<p>
Your name and score are shown in your team color in the upper
left.  The scoreboard lists all the players (in order by score),
their scores, what flag they are carrying (if any), and the
number of times you've killed and been killed by that player.
Your current status is at the top center.  Press the right
mouse button to start playing!
</p>

<h3>Trouble</h3>
<p>
Typical problems with BZFlag involve either the graphics or the
network.
</p>
<p>
<b>Graphics</b>: BZFlag uses OpenGL for rendering.  If you don't have
a graphics card that accelerates OpenGL you'll never get a good
frame rate.  Some cards support OpenGL better than others so you
may want to fiddle with the graphics options in the `Options'
menu if your frame rate is low or the graphics look wrong.  The
`t' and `y' keys toggle frame rate and time-per-frame readouts.
If you are having very low framerates, ensure that Lighting and
Shadows are off.
</p>
<p>
If the game runs but the rendering is wrong, your OpenGL driver
is broken.  It is <b>not</b> a problem with BZFlag. Try getting
the latest OpenGL drivers from your card manufacturer (or
the latest reference drivers from the chipset manufacturer).
</p>
<p>
<strong>99%</strong> of graphics problems are caused by
<strong>old or incompatible video drivers</strong>. The video
drivers that come with Windows or are distributed through
Windows Update are <strong>never</strong> current
and do not provide the OpenGL functions BZFlag needs. Always get
the current driver for your video card from the card manufacturer
or chipset company. This is almost always one of the companies
below. If you are using a laptop you may have to get the current
driver from your laptop manufacturer.
</p>
<p>
Common video chipsets:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp">nVidia</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ati.com/support/driver.html">ATI</a></li>
<li><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/">Intel</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
BZFlag prints the renderer name when it starts up in the message
window.  If it says `GDI Generic' then you're using software only.
You either haven't installed the OpenGL ICD correctly, or you are
not using the right drivers.  Quit the game, fix the problem and
run BZFlag again.
</p>
<p>
One exception to this is if the rendering is too dark.  This is
because BZFlag assumes a linear brightness mapping, but this isn't
true unless you've set the appropriate gamma correction for your
display.  If your graphics card supports `gamma correction' in the
`Advanced' section of the display control panel, then modify the
gamma to a level that makes BZFlag look better.  Gamma correction
should be a standard part of the operating system, but as of
Windows 98 and NT 4.0 Microsoft has neglected to do this.  If your
card doesn't support gamma correction, you'll simply have to adjust
the brightness slider in the options to get the brightest results
you can.
</p>
<p>
<b>Network</b>:  Network problems can be more difficult to track down.
If BZFlag complains that it Winsock isn't available or is the
wrong version, download Winsock 2 from the Microsoft website and
install it.  Watch out for beta versions of Winsock.  One beta
version has a bug that causes BZFlag to run at no more than one
frame per second.
</p>
<p>
If you can start BZFlag but can't seem to join any servers, try
starting one on your own system.  If this fails, it's probably
because bzfs.exe wasn't found.  You should put bzflag.exe and
bzfs.exe in the same directory and run BZFlag from that directory.
This is how the installer sets things up.  Quit BZFlag, fix the
problem, and restart.
</p>
<p>
If you're sure bzfs.exe is being found, check that you've got
TCP/IP networking setup.  If you can access the network using a
web browser then TCP/IP should be setup correctly.  If not, try
getting the browser working then try BZFlag again.
</p>
<p>
If you can connect to a server on your own host but not other
hosts then your TCP/IP networking probably isn't setup properly or
your network cable isn't hooked into the network.  Again, try to
get a web browser working across your network then try BZFlag again.
</p>
<p>
If you can't find servers on your network, there either aren't any
servers or they're running on nonstandard ports.  Either `Start
Server' or enter the server host name and port manually on the
`Join Game' menu then Connect.
</p>
<p>
If you're using BZFlag over a modem, you'll need to start Windows'
Dial-up Networking and connect to the internet before starting BZFlag.
