Welcome to the Linux version of BZFlag!

BZFlag is a network multiplayer 3D tank battle game.  You can play
against several other people anywhere on a TCP/IP based network,
including the Internet.  BZFlag is free and open source;  please
read the LICENSE file in the bzflag-1.7e.000 directory off the
standard doc directory (probably /usr/doc).

Both software and hardware rendering is supported.  Note that
software rendering is very slow -- this will not be fixed.
Hardware rendering is through whatever hardware OpenGL support
you have.  Matrox G200 and G400 cards are known to work, as
are 3Dfx based boards.  Note that 3Dfx passthrough card users
must use the `-3dfx' option to enable the 3Dfx card.  The usual
glide access rules apply for 3Dfx users:  if you don't use
/dev/3dfx you'll need to run bzflag as root.

Most users will use Mesa for OpenGL support.  Mesa is available
from www.mesa3d.org.  The glide libraries for 3Dfx users are
available from www.3dfx.com.

More information about bzflag is available in the man pages for
bzflag, bzfs, bzfls, and bzfrelay.  Also check:

Known bugs in the Linux version:

  * screen redraw problems when using accelerated glx.  normally
    only happens, if at all, when you change video format.  the
    workaround is to press ctrl+alt+'+' or ctrl+alt+'-' after exit
    to change the video format.  restart the X server if that
    doesn't work.  this appears to be a problem in glx.

  * window sizing weirdness.  if you have a 3Dfx card and want
    to use a resolution other than 640x480 then use the -3dfx
    and -geometry options.  if you don't have a 3Dfx card then
    try the -no3dfx option.

Known issues:

  * rpm may complain about missing libGL and/or libGLU.  just
    use --nodeps and make sure you've got Mesa installed.  Mesa
    3.1 provides these libraries while earlier versions provided
    libMesaGL and libMesaGLU.  The earlier versions (starting
    with version 2.6) will work as long as there is a symbolic
    link from libGL to libMesaGL and from libGLU to libMesaGLU.

  * if rendering is very slow on your hardware, try turning off
    some rendering options.  in particular, turn off shadows
    and smoothing as some hardware doesn't accelerate the
    necessary OpenGL operations.

  * some sound drivers don't support the SNDCTL_DSP_SETFORMAT
    ioctl.  in this case bzflag uses SNDCTL_DSP_POST to flush
    partial buffers which may not work well on some drivers.
    use -mute to disable sound.
