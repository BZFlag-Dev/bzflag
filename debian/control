Description: a 3D first person tank battle game
 BZFlag is a 3D multi-player multiplatform tank battle game
 that allows users to play against each other in a network
 environment. There are five teams: red, green, blue,
 purple and rogue (rogue tanks are black).  Destroying a
 player on another team scores a win, while being destroyed
 or destroying a teammate scores a loss. Rogues have no
 teammates (not even other rogues), so they cannot shoot
 teammates and they do not have a team score.
 .
 There are two main styles of play: capture-the-flag and
 free-for-all. In capture-the-flag, each team (except
 rogues) has a team base and each team with at least one
 player has a team flag. The object is to capture an enemy
 team's flag by bringing it to your team's base. This
 destroys every player on the captured team, subtracts one
 from that team's score, and adds one to your team's score.
 In free-for-all, there are no team flags or team bases.
 The object is simply to get as high a score as possible.

Description: bzfs - BZFlag game server
 bzfs is the server for BZFlag, and it must be running to
 play. It can be run on any system on the network
 (including a player's system or one without graphics).
 Terminating the server terminates the game in progress.
