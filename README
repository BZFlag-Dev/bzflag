Introduction
============

This is the readme file for the BZFlag source tree.  It includes
a manifest, simple build instructions, and other information for
bzflag development.


BZFlag Home Page
================

The BZFlag home page is at:  http://BZFlag.org/


Getting BZFlag
==============

The home page provides access to the primary BZFlag download
site.  This web site includes pages for downloading the compiled
and source code versions.  Compiled versions are distributed
as installable packages.  Source code is archived in various
formats.  After unpacking you should have the following files
in the new bzflag directory:

  README	- this file
  README.*	- platform specific details
  BUGS		- a list of known bugs
  LICENSE	- the bzflag license
  PORTING	- a guide for porting bzflag
  RELNOTES	- release notes for this and prior versions
  TODO		- (incomplete) list of things to do
  Make-common	- definitions and rules for all make files
  Make-sys	- Makefile that does the real work at the top level
  Makefile	- top level Makefile
  configs/	- platform configuration files
  data/		- data files (sounds, images, etc.)
  include/	- include files for libraries
  man/		- man pages
  misc/		- miscellany
  package/	- stuff to build installable packages
  src/		- bzflag, bzfs, etc. source code
    bzflag/	  - bzflag app source code (game client)
    bzfls/	  - bzfls app source code (list of servers server)
    bzfrelay/	  - bzfrelay source code (firewall relay for servers)
    bzfs/	  - bzfs app source code (game server)
    common/	  - general purpose classes
    geometry/	  - geometry rendering classes
    net/	  - networking classes and functions
    obstacle/	  - collision detection stuff
    ogl/	  - OpenGL utility classes
    platform/	  - platform dependent code
    scene/	  - high level rendering algorithms
  win32/	- extra stuff for building on win32 platforms


Compiling and Installation
==========================

Building BZFlag for a supported platform normally requires two
steps:

  % make <platform>
  % make

The first make configures the build for the named platform.
The second make actually does the build.  Doing make without
configuring for a platform lists the available platforms.
You can also append `-debug' to a platform name to configure
a debug build.

Some platforms may be different.  See the README file
appropriate to your system for more information:

  Platform			README file
  --------			-----------
  UNIX, Linux			README.UNIX
  Solaris				README.SOLARIS
  Windows 95/98/NT		README.WIN32


After a successful build, run bzflag using:

  % ./bin/bzflag

The first make configures the build for a particular platform.
The second builds bzflag, bzfs, etc.  If you enter `make'
without having configured a platform, you'll get a list of
available platforms.

bzflag is built into ./bin;  ./bin/bzflag runs bzflag and
it will automatically look in ./data for the data files.

** IMPORTANT **
BZFlag will look for the data files in . and ./data.  If
you run BZFlag from the bin directory, it will fail to
find the files and die with `cannot continue without
font fixedbr'.  Either run BZFlag as indicated above
or use the `-directory <data-directory>' command line
option to explicitly name the data directory.

You can also build an installable package using:

  % make package

The package will be placed in ./dist;  the exact form of the
package depends on the platform.

There are three cleanup targets:  clean, clobber, and
pristine.  `make clean' removes intermediate files but
leaves bzflag and other programs and any man pages.  `make
clobber' removes everything clean does and also programs
and man pages.  `make pristine' removes everything clobber
does and also packages, directories created during the build,
and the platform configuration;  this should get the source
tree back to its original state.

To build BZFlag for an unsupported platform, see PORTING.

The ./config file has a number of build options that you
may find interesting.


Mailing Lists
=============

There are two BZFlag mailing lists, a user list and a
developer's list.  The former is for general BZFlag
discussion and annoucements.  The latter is for coding and
development discussion only.

To join a mailing list, go to http://BZFlag.org/email-list.html/ and
follow the info there.

Contributions
=============

Patched should be entered into the patch tracking system on
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bzflag/  If you like you may also
send mail to either the BZFlag development mailing list, or
Tim@Rikers.org (the development mailing list is prefered) to discuss
contributions to the official BZFlag source code.  Small changes can be
attached to the mail in 'cvs diff' format.


Bug Reports
===========

For bug reports please go to bug tracking system on
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bzflag/ Alternatively, you can email
bug reports to Tim@Rikers.org but the web based method is the prefered
way to submit bugs.


Known Bugs
==========

See BUGS.

Source Tree Organization
========================

Note that include/ does not have all the include files.  If
a header is used entirely within a library (i.e. it doesn't
directly provide functionality outside the library) then
the header is found in the library's directory under src/.
An include file goes in include/ only if it's required by
another library or libraries or executables.  While this
complicates locating a header file (it can be in one of
two places instead of just one place), you can instantly
tell if a header file is (can be) used by clients of the
library.


UDP added by Frank Siegert, frank@this.net, frank@bzflag.de

This Client and Server now implement UDP unicast relay networking. It
should provide much better timing and stability compared to the old TCP
way. To stress test the new way the Client now always forces to relay
even if Multicasting is available. Please use an older client if you
need to run multicasting.

This release is compatible with older networking. If this clients connects
to an older server the normal TCP based networking is used. Also if an older
client connects to a new server the same happens. Only if a newer client
and a new server connect the new protocol is engaged. You can see it on
the console of the client where some messages telling you about.

It is advisable to run only new clients together with new server as otherwise
the mixed networking may cause strange timing effects on the players.

2. It does not work, why?

- When I connect to a newer server with this client others report they can
  see me but I get 'black caps' after a few seconds for all other players?

Two possibilies:

a) you are behind a NAT router that is not forwarding UDP port 17200 to your
   system. If this is the case please put this port into the port forwarding
   rules.

b) you are behind a firewall or a desktop firewall (e.g. ZoneAlarm) that is
   blocking incoming UDP traffic. Please reconfigure the firewall or disable
   ZoneAlert for the game, for more intelligent desktop firewalls alike
   AtGuard just set them up to let UDP port 17200 to 17220 through.

Testing
=======

If you have rendering problems you might want to try setting:

LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1

On many systems this will force software rendering. It will greatly reduce
the performance, but may solve rendering issues.
