README for SDL platforms
------------------------

BZFlag has a working cross-platform SDL interface that may be used for
graphics, event/input handling, media file support, and more.  The SDL
build is enabled by default on most platforms.  To disable it, you
must tell the configure script:

./configure --without-SDL

For information on enabling SDL on windows builds, see README.WINDOWS

See the BUGS and TODO files for known issues.
