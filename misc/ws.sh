# thanx!

# removed a trailing space from your post. ;-)
# unexpand works for leading space but not later in the lines.
# adding --all will convert 2 spaces to a tab inside a string
# if they are aligned correctly. That's a Bad Thing.
# GNU "indent" screws up all kinds of stuff including
# *foo and &foo references. It has no knowledge of c++
#
# other thoughts?

# Welcome to the whitespace posting board.
#
# "man unexpand"
#
# unexpand -t 8 -a file > file2  (then do some moving)
#
# That program takes the tab positions into account.
# I don't know how standard it is (it is in the debian
# coreutils package if that's any indication), but I
# would suggest having the script simply bail on that
# conversion if it isn't present.


# Note: this script will not alter any files that already
# meet the BZFlag whitespace usage guidelines.
# if your files are being messed up by this, then chances
# are they are _already_ messed up when others look at them
# ie: you are now seeing what others see when they look at your
# messed up whitespace. If you find that this script can be
# improved to help your files be more compliant with the
# BZFlag whitespace guidelines, feel free to improve the script
# it will soon be run automatically from time to time, so
# if it messes up your code, then either fix it, or fix your code.
# Feel free to send specific examples to Tim Riker and he'll try
# to improve the script.
#	Thanx! Tim "ws king" Riker

# hmm... the 8 spaces to tab rule is a likely candidate:
# this        foo
# this	      foo
# those two line up before the script and won't afterwards
# timr will look into fixing that.
