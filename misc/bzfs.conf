# Enables inertia and sets the maximum linear and angular accelerations.
# The units are somewhat arbitrary so you'll have to experiment to find
# suitable values.  The values must be non-negative and higher values
# yield greater inertia.

#-a <vel> <rot>

# Define a lag threshold over which players with high lag will be
# announced to the admin channel.

#-adminlagannounce 300

# Define a message which will be broadcast to all players every 15
# minutes.

#-admsg "This message gets sent to users every 15 minutes."

# When -c  is  supplied,  this  option randomly rotates the buildings.

# Automatically assigns players to teams when they join so that teams are
# evenly matched in number of players.  Players are placed on teams with
# lowest number of players first, then those with the lowest scores or
# kill ratios.

#-autoteam

# This option allows world objects to be randomly rotated. Only applies
# if a randomly generated world is used.

#-b

# This option sets up your ban list.  This is ip masks separated by
# commas.

#-ban "192.168.1.5,10.10.2.*,10.2.*.*"

# This option tells the server where to store the banlist. The banlist will
# be loaded from this file when the server starts (if the file exists) and
# written back to the file when someone gets banned or unbanned. If this
# option isn't used the banlist will not be saved.

#-banfile mybanfile

# Specify a file that contains bad words that will be used when either
# -filterCallsigns or -filterChat is enabled.

#-badwords /conf/multilingualSwearList.txt

# Turn on the filtering of chat messages.  Messages have words provided
# via a  -badwords file are replaced with !@#$%^&* characters.

#-filterChat

# Turn on the filtering of callsigns.  Callsigns are compared against
# bad words provided via -badwords.

#-filterCallsigns

# By default, all filtering is aggressive, matching much more than what
# is strictly listed in a -badwords file for convenience. Providing this
# option will make the -filterCallsigns and -filterChat comparisons
# exact match only.

#-filterSimple

# This enables capture-the-flag style game. Default is free-for-all style
# game.

#-c

# Enables capture-the-flag style game with a balanced random map. Default is
# free-for-all style game.

# There are two sets of flags. Flags that must be in the world at all times
# and flags that may get generated randomly in addition. +f specifies flags that
# must be there and -f specifies flags the should not be randomly generated.

# The server will randomly generate flags from the following list.  If you
# want to be sure there is at least a certain amount of a flag on the map
# at any given time, you can use the +f option to guarantee a certain
# number of a flag by repeating the option that many times.  So to insure
# there are at least 4 Oscillation Overthrusters you would do the
# following, minus the # signs.  Using "+f good" is the equivalent of
# doing +f for each of the good flags.  You are allowed to specify more than
# one team flag in CTF games.

# If you want to restrict a certain flag, you can use the -f option.
# just like with the +f option.  "-f bad" is the same as doing -f for
# all of the bad flags.  You might want to turn off jump and ricochet
# flags if the server already has jump and ricochet turned on.

#-f bad
#-f JP
