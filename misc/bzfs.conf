# The server will listen on this port.  Default port is 5154.

# UDP: UDP is a connectionless network communications protocol. When

# Advertising your server (making it public).
#------------------------------------------------

# Tells server not to respond to "pings". This makes the server

# This is the public message that the server advertises on the public
# server list.  This is required if you want to be shown on the list.
# It often advertises the map you are using.  Keep it short.

# Things you'll never need to change, but are here in case you do:

# Server will listen for and respond to "pings" (sent via broadcast) on
# the given interface.  The server uses the first interface by default.
# This is the TCP/UDP/IP address the server will listen on.
# You probably don't need to use this unless your server has multiple
# interfaces and doesn't show up on the server lists.

# This specifies where the server advertises itself.  The built-in

# Physics (how the world behaves)
#------------------------------------------------

# Enables inertia and sets the maximum linear and angular accelerations.
# The units are somewhat arbitrary so you'll have to experiment to find

#-a <vel> <rot>

# This option allows jumping.

# This makes most shots ricochet.

# Disable radar
#-noradar

# Maximum number of shots before a reload. The default is 1.
-ms 2

# This forces all clients to use the same time of day.  The time is

# This forces all clients to use the same location (the server's).

# Not strictly a game style, but this make more sense in some styles
# than others: on collision (shot) freeze the player farthest from
# home base
-freezeTag

# This option allows you to tell the server how long a team flag remains
# before it is reset after the last player on a team leaves.  The default
# is 30 seconds.
#-tftimeout 60

# This option requires a timed game to be started using the /countdown
# command to start a timed game.  Default is when first player joins.
#-timemanual

# This sets time limit on each game in format of either seconds or
# ending time in x[x]:[xx:[xx]] format
#-time 3600

# This option sets the max score for players.  The game ends when a person
# reaches this score and is declared the winner.
#-mps 100

# This sets the max team score.  The first team to reach this score is
# declared the winner and the game is ended.
#-mts 250



# This option causes the server to quit after serving one game.  This is
