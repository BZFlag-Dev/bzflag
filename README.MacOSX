BZFlag README for Mac OS X
==========================

BZFlag generally runs rather nicely on Mac OS X and is equivalent to
the other fully-supported platforms.  Included below are instructions
on installing BZFlag both from a binary and from a released source
distribution.

Binary Distribution
-------------------

See the project site downloads of BZFlag for Mac OS X
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3248&package_id=53923
to obtain the latest binary distribution.

Once you've obtained a binary distribution of BZFlag, installation
should be a simple matter of copying the icon provided in the disk
mounting image (the .dmg) to your Applications folder.  If you cannot
run the client at all (e.g. it starts to a black screen or the icon
bounces but then nothing happens), you can try several things:

  1) Remove any existing BZFlag directory in your personal application
     support folder:  rm -rf "~/Library/Application Support/BZFlag"

  2) Switch to a lower resolution before running the game.  Some older
     cards don't have enough memory to run BZFlag (8+ MB is preferred)
     at higher resolutions.

  3) Run the binary directly by using Terminal:
     /Applications/BZFlag-2.4.2.app/Contents/MacOS/BZFlag

If you still have issues running the game, please submit a bug report
to the project site bug tracker:

  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=3248&atid=103248

If the game starts but unexpectedly crashes or locks up your system,
please file a bug report with the details of what is occuring.  You
can try turning off the Lighting option in the game to see if that
helps with the crashes.

Source Distribution
-------------------

It is recommended to build BZFlag using the XCode project in the top-level
directory, which will provide you with a double-clickable BZFlag.app build.
You may also compile from the command line using the usual autogen.sh (if
building from SVN), configure, and make. Do NOT run 'make install' as this
does not work properly on OSX.  Instead, just run BZFlag out of the source
directory by running 'src/bzflag/bzflag' in the terminal.

It is highly recommended that sources be obtained from the
Sourceforge project site:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3248&package_id=3165

You'll want the .tar.gz source tarball, NOT the .zip source file.

For either build approach, you'll need to first install the SDL
framework into your /Library/Frameworks folder.

Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) PRESENTLY REQUIRES SDL VERSION 1.2 and
will likely not work with newer 1.3 or 2.0+ versions.

The SDL framework can be obtained from http://libsdl.org/download.php
where you will need the "Runtime Libraries" download for Mac OS X.
Once SDL is installed, you may then proceed with compilation.

To compile using the command-line approach, open up Terminal (which is
located in your /Applications/Utilities folder) and run the following:

./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

(Note: If running OS 10.5, you will need to provide the
--enable-freetype-build argument to configure)

Again, do NOT run 'make install' after you run 'make'.

Alternatively, you may compile using the provided XCode project, which
should result in a BZFlag application in the generated "build" folder
if there were no compilation errors.

NOTICE: If you're compiling from source, it is expected that you have
sufficient/proficient understanding of how to compile applications on
the command line or using XCode and how to perform compilation
troubleshooting without assistance.  This holds particularly true for
all alpha/beta testing releases as well as for any sources pulled
directly from the Subversion source repository checkout. If you have
problems building from a checkout, you should try building from an
official release that we have posted to SourceForge to see if you can
duplicate the issue, and then ask us for assistance.

See the instructions in README and INSTALL for more details.
