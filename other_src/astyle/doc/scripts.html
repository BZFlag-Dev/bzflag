    <h1>
        Artistic Style Scripts</h1>

    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        The following are scripts to support the Artistic Style program. They are in various computer languages for multiple
        platforms.</p>
    <p>
        On Windows Vista the following scripts may be blocked to help protect the computer. You will get a Security Warning
        message when trying to open or edit the extracted file. Right click on the file and select Properties. At the
        bottom of the General tab is a Security option. Select "Unblock" to unblock the file. This can be done with either
        the extracted or the zip file.</p>

        Scripts</h3>

    <p>
        <a href="http://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/astyle/trunk/AStyleDev/downloads/astyle-clean.py.zip"><strong>astyle-clean.py</strong></a>&nbsp;
        is a <strong>Python script</strong> to clean a directory tree by moving Artistic Style backup files to a separate
        directory. This allows Artistic Style to create backup files without cluttering your source directories. There
        are four variables at the start of the script that need to be set for each application. The script will move or
        copy backup files to a backup directory maintaining the original directory structure. New backup files will be
        copied over the old so you will always have the most current backup.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/astyle/trunk/AStyleDev/downloads/astyle-clean.sh.zip"><strong>astyle-clean.sh</strong></a>&nbsp;
        is a <strong>Linux shell script</strong> to clean a directory tree by moving Artistic Style backup files to a
        separate directory. This allows Artistic Style to create backup files without cluttering your source directories.
        There are four variables at the start of the script that need to be set for each application. The script will
        move or copy backup files to a backup directory maintaining the original directory structure. New backup files
        will be copied over the old so you will always have the most current backup.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/astyle/trunk/AStyleDev/downloads/astyle-clean.bat.zip"><strong>astyle-clean.bat</strong></a>&nbsp;
        is a <strong>Windows batch file</strong> to clean a directory tree by moving Artistic Style backup files to a
        separate directory. This allows Artistic Style to create backup files without cluttering your source directories.
        There are four variables at the start of the script that need to be set for each application. The script will
        move or copy backup files to a backup directory maintaining the original directory structure. New backup files
        will be copied over the old so you will always have the most current backup.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/astyle/trunk/AStyleDev/downloads/astyle.pl.zip"><strong>astyle.pl</strong></a>&nbsp;
        is a <strong>Mac Perl script</strong> to indent source files in TextWrangler and BBEdit using Artistic Style.
        Selected text from the editor can be passed to Artistic Style and replaced with the reformatted text. Save the
        script in the "Unix Filters" directory (you need to restart TextWrangler to see new scripts). Then simply highlight
        the text you would like to indent, choose the script from the Shebang (<code>#!</code>) menu, and the text will
        be immaculately formatted. You can add Artistic Style options to the "my $astyle" line in the script.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/astyle/trunk/AStyleDev/downloads/indent-commit.pl.zip"><strong>indent-commit.pl</strong></a>&nbsp;
        is a <strong>Perl script</strong> to integrate Artistic Style with a CVS repository check-in. Before code is checked in,
        Artistic Style is automatically called so that the repository files have a consistent style. This script was posted
        on the web site several years ago and probably needs to be updated.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/astyle/trunk/AStyleDev/downloads/astyle-hooks.el.zip"><strong>astyle-hooks.el</strong></a>&nbsp;
        is an <strong>Emacs Lisp script</strong> containing hooks to convert Emacs default styles to Artistic Style default
        styles. There are hooks for C++, Java, and C# files. The C# hook requires the csharp-mode.el file from <a href="https://code.google.com/p/csharpmode/">
            csharpmode</a> on Google Project Hosting. For best results Artistic Style should use the options &#8209;&#8209;min&#8209;conditional&#8209;indent=0
        (&#8209;m0) and &#8209;&#8209;max&#8209;instatement&#8209;indent=50 (&#8209;M50). Emacs does not seem to have
        an option equivalent to these. The formatting for Emacs and Artistic Style will not be identical but should be
        reasonably close.</p>
