    <h1>
        Artistic Style Subversion Repository</h1>

    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>

    <h3>
        Artistic Style</h3>

    <p>
        The latest development source is in the Artistic Style repository at SourceForge. It can be checked out using
        Subversion. The source code is under development and some changes take several weeks to complete. The intermediate
        source files have not been through the extensive system tests that are done before each release. Use reasonable
        precautions when using source code from the repository.</p>
    <p>
        The repository address is "https://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/astyle". The current version is in the "trunk/AStyle"
        branch of the repository. The file and directory names in the repository are case sensitive.</p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        <strong>svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/astyle/trunk/AStyle"&nbsp; "$HOME/astyle"</strong></p>
    <p>
        You can also <a href="http://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/astyle/">browse the subversion repository</a>.
        This gives you a view into the current status of the project's code without actually checking-out the files.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>

    <h3>
        Other Projects</h3>

    <p>
        Two additional Artistic Style projects are available in the repository. They are not maintained for the general
        public but are available if you want them. You may have to create your own project files and scripts to use them.
        These projects require the Artistic Style project above. They are an extension that requires the Artistic Style
        source. All projects, and any additional source required, should be installed in the same top level folder.</p>

    <h4>
        AStyleDev</h4>

    <p>
        AStyleDev contains the development files that are made available in the "Developer Information" section. Refer
        to that section for more information.</p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/astyle/trunk/AStyleDev"&nbsp; "$HOME/astyledev"
        .</p>

    <h4>
        AStyleTest</h4>

    <p>
        AStyleTest contains the unit test programs and test scripts for Artistic Style.</p>
    <p>
        In addition to the Artistic Style source the unit test program requires the program <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/"
            target="astyle" title="open new window">Google Mock</a>. An optional leak finder program can be added if you
        are using Visual Studio. It can be found at <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/applications/leakfinder.aspx"
            target="astyle" title="open new window">Memory(-Leak) and Exception Trace (CRT and COM Leaks)</a> at "The
        Code Project". You have to search through the message board at the bottom of the description to find the most
        current release. As of May 2011, the most current download is <a href="http://blog.kalmbachnet.de/files/LeakFinder-RC11.zip">
            http://blog.kalmbachnet.de/files/LeakFinder-RC11.zip</a>.</p>
