==============================================================================

1. libcurl

1.1 Zero-copy interface

 Introduce another callback interface for upload/download that makes one less
 copy of data and thus a faster operation.
 [http://curl.haxx.se/dev/no_copy_callbacks.txt]

1.2 More data sharing

 curl_share_* functions already exist and work, and they can be extended to
 share more. For example, enable sharing of the ares channel and the
 connection cache.

1.3 struct lifreq

 Use 'struct lifreq' and SIOCGLIFADDR instead of 'struct ifreq' and
 SIOCGIFADDR on newer Solaris versions as they claim the latter is obsolete.
 To support ipv6 interface addresses for network interfaces properly.

1.4 signal-based resolver timeouts

 libcurl built without an asynchronous resolver library uses alarm() to time
 out DNS lookups. When a timeout occurs, this causes libcurl to jump from the
 signal handler back into the library with a sigsetjmp, which effectively
 causes libcurl to continue running within the signal handler. This is
 non-portable and could cause problems on some platforms. A discussion on the
 problem is available at http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-09/0197.html

 Also, alarm() provides timeout resolution only to the nearest second. alarm
 ought to be replaced by setitimer on systems that support it.

2. libcurl - multi interface

2.1 More non-blocking

 Make sure we don't ever loop because of non-blocking sockets returning
 EWOULDBLOCK or similar. Blocking cases include:

 - Name resolves on non-windows unless c-ares is used
 - GnuTLS SSL connections
 - NSS SSL connections
 - Active FTP connections
 - HTTP proxy CONNECT operations
 - SOCKS proxy handshakes
 - file:// transfers
 - TELNET transfers
 - The "DONE" operation (post transfer protocol-specific actions) for the
   protocols SFTP, SMTP, FTP. Fixing Curl_done() for this is a worthy task.

2.2 Remove easy interface internally

 Make curl_easy_perform() a wrapper-function that simply creates a multi
 handle, adds the easy handle to it, runs curl_multi_perform() until the
 transfer is done, then detach the easy handle, destroy the multi handle and
 return the easy handle's return code. This will thus make everything
 internally use and assume the multi interface. The select()-loop should use
 curl_multi_socket().

2.3 Avoid having to remove/readd handles

 curl_multi_handle_control() - this can control the easy handle (while) added
 to a multi handle in various ways:

 o RESTART, unconditionally restart this easy handle's transfer from the
   start, re-init the state

 o RESTART_COMPLETED, restart this easy handle's transfer but only if the
   existing transfer has already completed and it is in a "finished state".

 o STOP, just stop this transfer and consider it completed

 o PAUSE?

 o RESUME?

2.4 Fix HTTP Pipelining for PUT

 HTTP Pipelining can be a way to greatly enhance performance for multiple
 serial requests and currently libcurl only supports that for HEAD and GET
 requests but it should also be possible for PUT.


3. Documentation

3.1  More and better

 Exactly

4. FTP

4.1 PRET

 PRET is a command that primarily "drftpd" supports, which could be useful
 when using libcurl against such a server. It is a non-standard and a rather
 oddly designed command, but...
 http://curl.haxx.se/bug/feature.cgi?id=1729967

4.2 Alter passive/active on failure and retry

 When trying to connect passively to a server which only supports active
 connections, libcurl returns CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_PASV_REPLY and closes the
 connection. There could be a way to fallback to an active connection (and
 vice versa). http://curl.haxx.se/bug/feature.cgi?id=1754793

4.3 Earlier bad letter detection

 Make the detection of (bad) %0d and %0a codes in FTP url parts earlier in the
 process to avoid doing a resolve and connect in vain.

4.4 REST for large files

 REST fix for servers not behaving well on >2GB requests. This should fail if
 the server doesn't set the pointer to the requested index. The tricky
 (impossible?) part is to figure out if the server did the right thing or not.

4.5 FTP proxy support

 Support the most common FTP proxies, Philip Newton provided a list allegedly
 from ncftp. This is not a subject without debate, and is probably not really
 suitable for libcurl.  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2003-04/0126.html

4.6 ASCII support

 FTP ASCII transfers do not follow RFC959. They don't convert the data
 accordingly.

5. HTTP

5.1 Better persistency for HTTP 1.0

 "Better" support for persistent connections over HTTP 1.0
 http://curl.haxx.se/bug/feature.cgi?id=1089001

5.2 support FF3 sqlite cookie files

 Firefox 3 is changing from its former format to a a sqlite database instead.
 We should consider how (lib)curl can/should support this.
 http://curl.haxx.se/bug/feature.cgi?id=1871388

5.3 Rearrange request header order

 Server implementors often make an effort to detect browser and to reject
 clients it can detect to not match. One of the last details we cannot yet
 control in libcurl's HTTP requests, which also can be exploited to detect
 that libcurl is in fact used even when it tries to impersonate a browser, is
 the order of the request headers. I propose that we introduce a new option in
 which you give headers a value, and then when the HTTP request is built it
 sorts the headers based on that number. We could then have internally created
 headers use a default value so only headers that need to be moved have to be
 specified.


6. TELNET

6.1 ditch stdin

Reading input (to send to the remote server) on stdin is a crappy solution for
library purposes. We need to invent a good way for the application to be able
to provide the data to send.

6.2 ditch telnet-specific select

 Move the telnet support's network select() loop go away and merge the code
 into the main transfer loop. Until this is done, the multi interface won't
 work for telnet.

6.3 feature negotiation debug data

  Add telnet feature negotiation data to the debug callback as header data.

6.4 send data in chunks

  Currently, telnet sends data one byte at a time.  This is fine for interactive
  use, but inefficient for any other.  Sent data should be sent in larger
  chunks.

7. SSL

7.1 Disable specific versions

 Provide an option that allows for disabling specific SSL versions, such as
 SSLv2 http://curl.haxx.se/bug/feature.cgi?id=1767276

7.2 Provide mutex locking API

 Provide a libcurl API for setting mutex callbacks in the underlying SSL
 library, so that the same application code can use mutex-locking
 independently of OpenSSL or GnutTLS being used.

7.3 Evaluate SSL patches

 Evaluate/apply Gertjan van Wingerde's SSL patches:
 http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2004-03/0087.html

7.4 Cache OpenSSL contexts

 "Look at SSL cafile - quick traces look to me like these are done on every
 request as well, when they should only be necessary once per ssl context (or
 once per handle)". The major improvement we can rather easily do is to make
 sure we don't create and kill a new SSL "context" for every request, but
 instead make one for every connection and re-use that SSL context in the same
 style connections are re-used. It will make us use slightly more memory but
 it will libcurl do less creations and deletions of SSL contexts.

7.5 Export session ids

 Add an interface to libcurl that enables "session IDs" to get
 exported/imported. Cris Bailiff said: "OpenSSL has functions which can
 serialise the current SSL state to a buffer of your choice, and recover/reset
 the state from such a buffer at a later date - this is used by mod_ssl for
 apache to implement and SSL session ID cache".

7.6 Provide callback for cert verification

 OpenSSL supports a callback for customised verification of the peer
 certificate, but this doesn't seem to be exposed in the libcurl APIs. Could
 it be? There's so much that could be done if it were!

7.7 Support other SSL libraries

 Make curl's SSL layer capable of using other free SSL libraries.  Such as
 MatrixSSL (http://www.matrixssl.org/).

7.8  Support SRP on the TLS layer

 Peter Sylvester's patch for SRP on the TLS layer.  Awaits OpenSSL support for
 this, no need to support this in libcurl before there's an OpenSSL release
 that does it.

7.9 improve configure --with-ssl

 make the configure --with-ssl option first check for OpenSSL, then GnuTLS,
 then NSS...

7.10 Make NTLM work with other crypto functions

 Get NTLM working using the functions provided by NSS etc. Not strictly
 SSL/TLS related, but hey... Another option is to get available DES and MD4
 source code from the cryptopp library. They are fine license-wise, but are
 C++. NTLM currenly only works when libcurl is built with OpenSSL or GnuTLS
 support.

8. GnuTLS

8.1 SSL engine stuff

 Is this even possible?

8.2 SRP

 Work out a common method with Peter Sylvester's OpenSSL-patch for SRP on the
 TLS to provide name and password. GnuTLS already supports it...

8.3 non-blocking

 Fix the connection phase to be non-blocking when multi interface is used

8.4 check connection

 Add a way to check if the connection seems to be alive, to correspond to the
 SSL_peak() way we use with OpenSSL.

9. Other protocols

9.1 ditch ldap-specific select

 * Look over the implementation. The looping will have to "go away" from the
   lib/ldap.c source file and get moved to the main network code so that the
   multi interface and friends will work for LDAP as well.

9.2 stop TFTP blocking

  Stop TFTP from being blocking and doing its own read loop in tftp_do.

10. New protocols

10.1 RTSP

 RFC2326 (protocol - very HTTP-like, also contains URL description)

10.2 RSYNC

 There's no RFC for protocol nor URI/URL format.  An implementation should
 most probably use an existing rsync library, such as librsync.

10.3 RTMP

 There exists a patch that claims to introduce this protocol:
 http://osdir.com/ml/gnu.gnash.devel2/2006-11/msg00278.html, further details
 in the feature-request: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/feature.cgi?id=1843469

11. Client

11.1 Content-Disposition

 Add option that is similar to -O but that takes the output file name from the
 Content-Disposition: header, and/or uses the local file name used in
 redirections for the cases the server bounces the request further to a
 different file (name): http://curl.haxx.se/bug/feature.cgi?id=1364676

11.2 sync

 "curl --sync http://example.com/feed[1-100].rss" or
 "curl --sync http://example.net/{index,calendar,history}.html"

 Downloads a range or set of URLs using the remote name, but only if the
 remote file is newer than the local file. A Last-Modified HTTP date header
 should also be used to set the mod date on the downloaded file.

11.3 glob posts

 Globbing support for -d and -F, as in 'curl -d "name=foo[0-9]" URL'.
 This is easily scripted though.

11.4 prevent file overwriting

 Add an option that prevents cURL from overwriting existing local files. When
 used, and there already is an existing file with the target file name
 (either -O or -o), a number should be appended (and increased if already
 existing). So that index.html becomes first index.html.1 and then
 index.html.2 etc.

11.5 ftp wildcard download

 "curl ftp://site.com/*.txt"

11.6 simultaneous parallel transfers

 The client could be told to use maximum N simultaneous parallel transfers and
 then just make sure that happens. It should of course not make more than one
 connection to the same remote host. This would require the client to use the
 multi interface. http://curl.haxx.se/bug/feature.cgi?id=1558595

11.7 provide formpost headers

 Extending the capabilities of the multipart formposting. How about leaving
 the ';type=foo' syntax as it is and adding an extra tag (headers) which
 works like this: curl -F "coolfiles=@fil1.txt;headers=@fil1.hdr" where
 fil1.hdr contains extra headers like

   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=KOI8-R"
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
   X-User-Comment: Please don't use browser specific HTML code

 which should overwrite the program reasonable defaults (plain/text,
 8bit...)

11.8 url-specific options

 Provide a way to make options bound to a specific URL among several on the
 command line. Possibly by letting ':' separate options between URLs,
 similar to this:

    curl --data foo --url url.com : \
        --url url2.com : \
        --url url3.com --data foo3

 (More details: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2004-07/0133.html)

 The example would do a POST-GET-POST combination on a single command line.

11.9 metalink support

 Add metalink support to curl (http://www.metalinker.org/). This is most useful
 with simultaneous parallel transfers (11.6) but not necessary.

11.10 warning when setting an option

  Display a warning when libcurl returns an error when setting an option.
  This can be useful to tell when support for a particular feature hasn't been
  compiled into the library.

12. Build

12.1 roffit

 Consider extending 'roffit' to produce decent ASCII output, and use that
 instead of (g)nroff when building src/hugehelp.c

13. Test suite

13.1 SSL tunnel

 Make our own version of stunnel for simple port forwarding to enable HTTPS
 and FTP-SSL tests without the stunnel dependency, and it could allow us to
 provide test tools built with either OpenSSL or GnuTLS

13.2 nicer lacking perl message

 If perl wasn't found by the configure script, don't attempt to run the tests
 but explain something nice why it doesn't.

13.3 more protocols supported

 Extend the test suite to include more protocols. The telnet could just do ftp
 or http operations (for which we have test servers).

13.4 more platforms supported

 Make the test suite work on more platforms. OpenBSD and Mac OS. Remove
 fork()s and it should become even more portable.

14. Next SONAME bump

14.1 http-style HEAD output for ftp

 #undef CURL_FTP_HTTPSTYLE_HEAD in lib/ftp.c to remove the HTTP-style headers
 from being output in NOBODY requests over ftp

14.2 combine error codes

 Combine some of the error codes to remove duplicates.  The original
 numbering should not be changed, and the old identifiers would be
 macroed to the new ones in an CURL_NO_OLDIES section to help with
 backward compatibility.

 Candidates for removal and their replacements:

    CURLE_FILE_COULDNT_READ_FILE => CURLE_REMOTE_FILE_NOT_FOUND
    CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_RETR_FILE => CURLE_REMOTE_FILE_NOT_FOUND
    CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_USE_REST => CURLE_RANGE_ERROR
    CURLE_FUNCTION_NOT_FOUND => CURLE_FAILED_INIT
    CURLE_LDAP_INVALID_URL => CURLE_URL_MALFORMAT
    CURLE_TFTP_NOSUCHUSER => CURLE_TFTP_ILLEGAL
    CURLE_TFTP_NOTFOUND => CURLE_REMOTE_FILE_NOT_FOUND
    CURLE_TFTP_PERM => CURLE_REMOTE_ACCESS_DENIED

14.3 extend CURLOPT_SOCKOPTFUNCTION prototype

 The current prototype only provides 'purpose' that tells what the
 connection/socket is for, but not any protocol or similar. It makes it hard
 for applications to differentiate on TCP vs UDP and even HTTP vs FTP and
 similar.

15. Next major release

15.1 cleanup return codes

 curl_easy_cleanup() returns void, but curl_multi_cleanup() returns a
 CURLMcode. These should be changed to be the same.

15.2 remove obsolete defines

 remove obsolete defines from curl/curl.h

15.3 size_t

 make several functions use size_t instead of int in their APIs

15.4 remove several functions

 remove the following functions from the public API:

 curl_getenv

 curl_mprintf (and variations)

 curl_strequal

 curl_strnequal

 They will instead become curlx_ - alternatives. That makes the curl app
 still capable of using them, by building with them from source.

 These functions have no purpose anymore:

 curl_multi_socket

 curl_multi_socket_all

15.5 remove CURLOPT_FAILONERROR

 Remove support for CURLOPT_FAILONERROR, it has gotten too kludgy and weird
 internally. Let the app judge success or not for itself.

15.6 remove CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE

 Remove support for a global DNS cache. Anything global is silly, and we
 already offer the share interface for the same functionality but done
 "right".

15.7 remove progress meter from libcurl

 The internally provided progress meter output doesn't belong in the library.
 Basically no application wants it (apart from curl) but instead applications
 can and should do their own progress meters using the progress callback.

 The progress callback should then be bumped as well to get proper 64bit
 variable types passed to it instead of doubles so that big files work
 correctly.
