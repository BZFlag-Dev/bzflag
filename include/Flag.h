/** @file
 * Flags add some spice to the game.  There are two kinds of flags:
 * team flags and super flags.  Super flags come in two types: good
 * and bad.
 *
 *   When playing a "capture the flag" style game, each team with at
 * least one player has a team flag which has the same color as the
 * team.  A team flag will remain in the game as long as there is a
 * player on that team.  A team flag may be picked up and freely
 * dropped at any time.  It may be captured, which causes it to go
 * back to it's home position (centered in the team base).  If a
 * flag is dropped by a hostile player in a third team's base, the
 * flag will go to the third team's flag safety position.  For example,
 * if a Green Team player dropped the Red Flag on Blue's Base, the
 * Red Flag would go to the Blue Team's safety position.  This is
 * because if it stayed in the Blue Base, any Red Team member who
 * picked it up would instantly have brought his team flag into
 * enemy territory and so blow up his whole team.
 *
 *   A super flag causes the characteristics of the tank that possesses
 * it to change.  A good super flag generally makes the tank more
 * powerful or deadly.  A bad super flag generally does the opposite.
 * A good super flag may always be dropped.  A bad super flag is
 * "sticky" which means that it can't be freely dropped.  The server
 * may have some means of getting rid of a bad super flag (perhaps
 * by destroying an enemy or two or after waiting 20 seconds).
 * The creation and destruction of super flags is under the server's
 * control so super flags may appear and disappear seemingly at
 * random.
