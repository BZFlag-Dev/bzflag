     * and ffRumble() will start playing a force feedback effect. For devices
     * lacking rumble, ffRumble() is a no-op.

     * Our rumble interface follows the precedent set by Linux's FF_RUMBLE.
     * The joypad can have up to two motors, named the 'weak' motor and the
     * 'strong' motor. The 'strong' motor is typical of what's found in console
     * gaming systems, while the 'weak' motor is for more subtle vibration
     * effects. The strength of each motor is specified as a value in the
     * range [0,1].
     *
     * The effect starts after the given delay in seconds, runs for a duration
     * also in seconds, and repeats a total of 'count' times. Currently only
     * one effect is supported at a time, so using a count of zero will cancel
     * any rumble that may be in progress.
